{"text": "Difference between star and delta connection Star Connection Delta Connection In STAR Connection, the starting or finishing ends (similar ends) of three coils are connected together to form the neutral point. A common wire is taken out from the neutral point which is called Neutral. In DELTA Connection, the opposite ends of three coils are connected together. In other words, the end of each coil is connected with the starting point of another coil, and three wires are taken out from the coil joints. There is a Neutral or Star Point. No Neutral Point in Delta Connection. Three phase four wire system is derived from Star Connections (3-Phase, 4 Wires System). We may Also derive 3 Phase 3 Wire System from Star Connection. Three phase three wire system is derived from Delta Connections (3-Phase, 3 Wires System). i.e. 3 Phase, Wire system is not possible in Delta Connection. Line Current is Equal to the Phase Current. i.e. Line Current = Phase Current IL = IPH Line Current is √3 times of Phase Current. i.e. IL = √3 IPH Line Voltage is √3 times of Phase Voltage. i.e. VL = √3 VPH Line Voltage is Equal to the Phase Voltage. i.e. Line Voltage = Phase Voltage VL = VPH In Star Connection, the Total Power of three Phases P = √3 x VL x IL x CosФ …. Or P = 3 x VPH x IPH x CosФ In delta Connection, the Total Power of three Phases P = √3 x VL x IL x CosФ …. Or P = 3 x VPH x IPH x CosФ The speeds of Star connected motors are slow as they receive 1/√3 voltage. The speeds of Delta connected motors are high because each phase gets the total of line voltage. In Star Connection, the phase voltage is low as 1/√3 of the line voltage. Therefore, it needs a low number of turns, hence saving in copper and low insulation cost. In Delta connection, The phase voltage is equal to the line voltage, hence it needs more number of turns which increase the total cost. Also high insulation cost. Star Connection is a common and general system which is used in Power transmission. Delta Connection is a typical system used in Distribution system and Industries.", "doc_name": "Chapter_3_Three phase ac.pdf", "page": 21, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Bee\\Module 3 Three Phase AC Circuits\\Chapter_3_Three phase ac.pdf", "subject": "BEE", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

If a metal pipe is buried in such a soil, the corrosive conditions are similar to those of oxygen concentration cell corrosion, the rate of corrosion is governed by the amount of moisture content in the soil. 2. Water- logged soils Water-logged soils contain very small amount of free oxygen, but various bacterias and micro-organisms can grow. This leads to micro-biological corrosion. 3. Intermediate character soils This type of soil may produce a localized corrosion. If air pockets are present, differential aeration corrosion may occur in different parts. 4.Soil with large amount of organic matter If the soil contains large amount of organic matter, the formation of soluble metal complexes and peptization of corrosion product may accelerate the corrosion process as compared to the soils, which are relatively free from organic matter. 5.Non-acids soils In non-acid soils, the conductivity ( which depends on moisture and electrolyte content) is the major factor governing the corrosive character. In such soils, corrosion follows differential aeration type corrosion. The rate of corrosion mainly depends on i) the resistance between the anodic and cathodic areas. ii) the rate of arrival of the oxygen to the cathodic areas.

Fig. 3.9 General intergranular attack This type of corrosion is generally encountered in alloys.

(II) Theory Suppose the anode is made of coating metal in the electrolytic cell. During electrolysis, the concentration of electrolytic bath remains unaltered, since the metal ions deposited from the bath on cathode are replenished continuously by the reaction of free anions with the anode. Example : If CuSO4 solution is used as an electrolyte, it ionises as CuSO Cu + SO 4 4 2+ 2- on passing current, Cu2+ ions go to the cathode and get deposited there. Cu + 2e Cu (at cathode) 2+ - The free sulphate ions migrate to the copper anode and dissolve an equivalent amount of copper to form CuSO4.

{"text": "Foreword Fifty years ago the student taking up organic chemistry—and I speak from experience—was almost certain to be referred to one or other of a few textbooks generally known by the name of their authors e.g. Holleman, Bernthsen, Schmidt, Karrer and Gattermann. On these texts successive generations of chemists were nurtured, and not in one country alone, for they were translated into several languages. These, the household names of fifty years ago, have for the most part gone. In past times of course the total number of books available was rather small and it is only in the last quarter of a century that we have seen a veritable flood of organic chemical textbooks pouriiig into book- sellers’ lists. The increase in the number of texts may be in part due to the rise in student numbers but the primary reason for it is the revolu- tionary impact of mechanistic studies on our approach to organic chemistry at the elementary level. With the plethora of books avail- able, however, it is now much more difficult for an author to become a household name wherever the subject is taught. Yet this has indeed happened to Dr. Peter Sykes through his Guidebook to Mechanism in Organic Chemistry. In the Foreword which I was privileged to write for the First Edition in 1961 I described not only my own view of what was happen- ing in organic chemistry but also the type of approach to teaching it which was favoured by Dr. Sykes. Having known and watched him over many years first as student, then as colleague, and always as friend, I was confident that he had written an excellent book which, in my view at least, would add new interest to the study of organic chemistry. But its success has far exceeded even my high expectations and in its later editions it has been revised and refined without ever losing the cutting edge of the original. The present volume continues the tradition. Once again the recent literature has been combed for new examples the better to exemplify principles of reactions. Of particular interest is an admirable chapter dealing with reactions controlled by orbital symmetry. Until I read it I was not convinced that this very important new development in the theory of organic reactions could be simply yet usefully communicated to students at an elementary level. To have succeeded in doing so only underlines further Dr. Sykes’ gifts as a teacher and writer and I am sure that this new edition of the Guidebook will more than equal the success of its predecessors.

{"text": "preface to sixth edition T jg now twenty-five years since this Guidebook first appeared and, hardly surprisingly, the current version is vastly different in both ontent and physical appearance from that first offering of so long Over the years a real endeavour has been made to incorporate new, and to delete old, material not to reflect current trends and fashions, but to encompass significant changes in our fundamental understanding of organic chemistry; more particularly, to decide how these changes can best be conveyed to a largely undergraduate audience. At the same time care has been taken to retain the underlying framework and structure of the book for the excellent, pragmatic reason that this has been found to work well in practice. The current version incorporates no new chapter but a number of new topics have been introduced, e.g. ipso aromatic substitution; the mechanistic borderline in nucleophilic substitution; more use of activation parameters, particularly in ester hydrolysis; Dimroth’s Ej- parameter; correlation of spectroscopic data with Hammett’s n.m.r. in biogenesis, etc. The now outmoded term ‘carbonium ion’ has been replaced throughout by ‘carbocation’, which has the advantage of being the natural antithesis to carbanion, and avoids the rather dubious alternative of carbenium ion. Apart from these more obvious changes, the whole text has been gone through, line by line, in an effort to remove ambiguities, to provide clearer, more cogent explanations, and more telling examples. The overall result, in garage parlance, has been a very thorough overhaul and extensive re-tune! It has always been my feeling that many textbooks fall short of their full potential because the author has never entirely made up his or her mind whether the subject matter is addressed wholly to students or, in part at least, to their mentors; and the requirements of the two are, after all, different. This new edition is directed, as were its predecessors, unequivocally at the student; I trust therefore that it will continue to prove helpful to chemistry students in general, irrespective of the particular institution in which they happen to be studying. As always I am greatly indebted to many correspondents who have pointed out errors, infelicities, and made suggestions for improvements; wherever feasible these have been incorporated in this revision. I should greatly appreciate similar kind assistance from readers in the future.", "doc_name": "Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "page": 5, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Reaction Mechanism\\Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

It is the business of this chapter to outline some of these guiding principles, and to show how they work. As it is the compounds of carbon with which we shall be dealing, something must be said about the way in which carbon atoms can form bonds with other atoms, especially with other carbon atoms. 1.1 ATOMIC ORBITALS The carbon atom has, outside its nucleus, six electrons which, on the Bohr theory of atomic structure, were believed to be arranged in orbits at increasing distance from the nucleus.

{"text": "2 Structure, reactivity, and mechanism ponded to gradually increasing levels of energy, that of lowest energy, the Is, accommodating two electrons, the next, the 2s, also accommo- dating two electrons, and the remaining two electrons of the carbon atom going into the 2p level, which is actually capable of accommo- dating a total of six electrons. The Heisenberg indeterminacy principle, and the wave-mechanical view of the electron, have made it necessary to do away with anything so precisely defined as actual orbits. Instead the wave-like electrons are now symbolised by wave functions, i/^, and the precise, classical orbits of Bohr are superseded by three-dimensional atomic orbitals of differing energy level. The size, shape and orientation of these atomic orbitals—regions in which there is the greatest probability of finding an electron corresponding to a particular, quantised energy level—are each delineated by a wave function, ij/^, ij/^, [j/f-, etc. The orbitals are indeed rather like three-dimensional electronic contour maps, in which determines the relative probability of finding an electron at a particular point in the orbital. The relative size of atomic orbitals, which is found to increase as their energy level rises, is defined by the principal quantum number, n, their shape and spatial orientation (with respect to the nucleus and each other) by the subsidiary quantum numbers, / and m, respectively.* Electrons in orbitals also have a further designation in terms of the spin quantum number, which can have the values -l-j or — j. One limitation that theory imposes on such orbitals is that each may accommodate not more than two electrons, these electrons being distinguished from each other by having opposed (paired) spins, t This follows from the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two electrons in any atom may have exactly the same set of quantum numbers. It can be shown, from wave-mechanical calculations, that the Is orbital (quantum numbers n = 1, / = 0, m = 0, corresponding to the classical K shell) is spherically symmetrical about the nucleus of the atom, and that the 2s orbital (quantum numbers n = 2,1 = 0,m = 0) is similarly spherically symmetrical, but at a greater distance from the nucleus; there is a region between the two latter orbitals where the probability of finding an electron approaches zero (a spherical nodal surface). As yet, this marks no radical departure from the classical picture of orbits, but with the 2p level (the continuation of the L shell) a difference becomes apparent. Theory now requires the existence of three 2p orbitals (quantum numbers n = 2, / = 1, with m = -f- 1, 0, and *n can have values of 1,2,3 / values of 0, 1,2, ...,n — I, and m values of 0, ± 1, ±2, . . . , +/.

{"text": "4 Structure, reactivity, and mechanism for the formation of bonds with other atoms, i.e. at first sight carbon might appear to be only divalent. This, however, is contrary to experience, for though compounds are known in which carbon is singly bonded to only two other atoms, e.g. CClj (p. 267), these are highly unstable; in the enormous majority of its compounds carbon exhibits quadrivalency, e.g. CH4. This can be achieved by uncoupling the 2s^ electron pair, and promoting one of them to the vacant 2p. orbital. The carbon atom is then in a higher energy (excited) state, ls^2s‘2pi2p‘2pi, but as it now hasfour unpaired electrons it is able to form four, rather than only two, bonds with other atoms or groups. The large amount of energy produced by forming these two extra bonds considerably outweighs that required [ss406 kJ (97 kcal) moP^] for the initial 2s^ uncoupling, and 2s 2p^ promotion. 1.2 HYBRIDISATION A carbon atom combining with four other atoms clearly does not use the one 2s and the three 2p atomic orbitals that would now be available, for this would lead to the formation of three directed bonds, mutually at right angles (with the three 2p orbitals), and one different, non- directed bond (with the spherical 2s orbital). Whereas in fact, the four C—H bonds in, for example, methane are known to be identical and symmetrically (tetrahedrally) disposed at an angle of 109° 28' to each other. This may be accounted for on the basis of redeploying the 2s and the three 2p atomic orbitals so as to yield four new (identical) orbitals, which are capable of forming stronger bonds (cf p. 5). These new orbitals are known as sp^ hybrid atomic orbitals, and the process by which they are obtained as hybridisation : 2p, 2p, 2pj sp’ hybrids It should, however, be emphasised, despite the diagram above, that hybridisation is an operation carried out not actually on orbitals themselves but on the mathematical functions that define them.", "doc_name": "Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "page": 10, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Reaction Mechanism\\Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

Finally, when carbon combines with two other atoms, e.g. in ethyne (acetylene) (p. 9); two sp* hybrid atomic orbitals disposed at 180° to each other (digonal hybridisation) are employed. In each case the s orbital is always involved as it is the one of lowest energy level. These are all valid ways of deploying one 2s and three 2p atomic orbitals—in the case of sp^ hybridisation there will be one unhybridised p orbital also available (p. 8), and in the case of sp‘ hybridisation there will be two (p. 10). Other, equally valid, modes of hybridisation are also possible in which the hybrid orbitals are not necessarily identical with each other, e.g. those used in CH2CI2 compared with the ones used in CCI4 and CH4 . Hybridisation takes place so that the atom concerned can form as strong bonds as possible, and so that the other atoms thus bonded (and the electron pairs constituting the bonds) are as far apart from each other as possible, i.e. so that the total intrinsic energy of the resultant compound is at a minimum. 1.3 BONDING IN CARBON COMPOUNDS Bond formation between two atoms is then envisaged as the progressive overlapping of an atomic orbital from each of the participating atoms, the greater the overlap achieved (the overlap integral), the stronger the bond so formed. The relative overlapping powers of atomic orbitals have been calculated as follows: s = too p = 1-72 sp‘ = 1-93 sp= = 1-99 sp^ = 2-00 It will thus be apparent why the use of hybrid orbitals, e.g. sp^ hybrid orbitals in the combination of one carbon and four hydrogen atoms to form methane, results in the formation of stronger bonds. When the atoms have come sufficiently close together, it can be shown that their two atomic orbitals are replaced by two molecular orbitals, one being at a lower, and the other at a higher, energy level than the two original atomic orbitals.

In the above case, the pair of electrons con- stituting the bond tend to be concentrated between the two positively charged atomic nuclei, which can thus be thought of as being held together by the negative charge between them. The molecular orbital of higher energy is called the anti-bonding orbital-, this corresponds to a state in which the intemuclear space remains largely empty of electrons, and thus results in repulsion between the two positively charged atomic nuclei. The anti-bonding orbital remains empty in the ground state of the molecule, and need not here be further considered in the formation of stable bonds between atoms. If overlap of the two atomic orbitals has taken place along their major axes, the resultant bonding molecular orbital is referred to as a a orbital,* and the bond formed as a <r bond. The a molecular orbital, and the electrons occupying it, are found to be localised symmetrically about the intemuclear axis of the atoms that are bonded to each other.

This is not really surprising, for an s orbital and any electrons in it are held closer to, and more tightly by, the nucleus than is a p orbital and any electrons in it.

That such crowding can lead to a real restriction of rotation about a carbon-carbon single bond has been confirmed by the isolation of two forms of CHBr2CHBr2 , though admittedly only at low tempera- tures where collisions between molecules do not provide enough energy to effect the interconversion. 13.2 Carbon-carbon double bonds In ethene each carbon atom is bonded to only three other atoms, two hydrogens and one carbon. Strong a bonds are formed with these three atoms by the use of three orbitals derived by hybridising the 2s and, this time, two only of the carbon atom’s 2p atomic orbitals—an atom will normally only mobilise as many hybrid orbitals as it has atoms or groups to form strong a bonds with. The resultant sp^ hybrid orbitals all lie in the same plane, and are inclined at 120° to each other {plane trigonal orbitals). In forming the molecule of ethene, two of the sp^ orbitals of each carbon atom are seen as overlapping with the Is orbitals of two hydrogen atoms to form two strong a C—H bonds, while the third sp^ orbital of each carbon atom overlap axially to form a strong a C—C bond between them. It is found experimentally that the H—C—H and H—C—C bond angles are in fact 116-7° and 121-6°, respectively. The departure from 120° is hardly surprising seeing that different trios of atoms are involved. This then leaves, on each carbon atom, one unhybridised 2p atomic orbital at right angles to the plane containing the carbon and hydrogen atoms. When these two 2p orbitals become parallel to each other they can themselves overlap, resulting in the formation of a bonding molecular orbital spreading over both carbon atoms and situated above and below the plane (i.e. it has a node in the plane of the molecule) containing the two carbon and four hydrogen atoms indicates bonds to atoms lying behind the plane of the paper, and V bonds to those lying in front of it): ^C-C. \"'6 t ” 'C-C", "doc_name": "Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "page": 14, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Reaction Mechanism\\Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

The new n bond that is thus formed has the effect of drawing the carbon atoms closer together, and the C—C distance in ethene is found to be 0133 nm (1-33 A), compared with a C—C distance of 0154nm (1-54 A) in ethane. The lateral overlap of the p atomic orbitals that occurs in forming a n bond is less effective than the axial overlap that occurs in forming a <T bond, and the former is thus weaker than the latter. This is reflected in the fact that the energy of a carbon-carbon double bond, though more than that of a single bond is, indeed, less than twice as much. Thus the C—C bond energy in ethane is 347 kJ (83 kcal) mol“ *, while that of C=C in ethene is only 598 kJ (143 kcal)mol~'. The lateral overlap of the two 2p atomic orbitals, and hence the strength of the ti bond, will clearly be at a maximum when the two carbon and four hydrogen atoms are exactly coplanar, for it is only in this position that the p atomic orbitals are exactly parallel to each other, and will thus be capable of maximum overlap. Any distur- bance of this coplanar state, by twisting about the a bond joining the two carbon atoms, would lead to reduction in n overlapping, and hence a decrease in the strength of the ir bond: it will thus be resisted. A theoretical justification is thus provided for the long observed resistance to rotation about a carbon-carbon double bond. The distribution of the tt electrons in two lobes, above and below the plane of the molecule, and extending beyond the carbon-carbon bond axis, means that a region of negative charge is effectively waiting there to welcome any electron-seeking reagents (e.g. oxidis- ing agents); so that it comes as no surprise to realise that the characteristic reactions of a carbon-carbon double bond are pre- dominandy with such reagents (cf. p. 178). Here the classical picture of a double bond has been replaced by an alternative, in which the two bonds joining the carbon atoms, far from being identical, are considered to be different in nature, strength and position. 1.3.3 Carbon-carbon triple bonds In ethyne each carbon atom is bonded to only two other atoms, one hydrogen and one carbon. Strong a bonds are formed with these two atoms by the use of two hybrid orbitals derived by hybridising the 2s and, this time, one only of the carbon atom’s 2p atomic orbitals.

The observed bond length is indeed short—0147nm (147 A)—though no shorter than might be expected for a single bond between sp^ hybridised carbon atoms (c/. p. 9). The stabilisation energy of a simple conjugated diene, compared with the corresponding isolated one, is relatively small ca. 17 kJ (4kcal)mor‘—and even this cannot be ascribed wholly to electron delocalisation : the state of hybridisation of the carbon atoms involved, and the consequent differing strengths of the o bonds between them, must also be taken into account. Delocalisation is, however, much involved in stabilising the excited states of dienes, and of polyenes in general, i.e. in lowering the energy level of their excited states. The effect of this is to reduce the energy gap between ground and excited states of conjugated molecules, as compared with those containing isolated double bonds, and this energy gap is progressively lessened as the extent of conjugation increases. This means that the amount of energy required to effect the promotion of an electron, from ground to excited state, decreases with increasing conjugation, i.e. the wavelength at which the necessary radiation is absorbed increases. Simple dienes absorb in the ultra- violet region, but as the extent of conjugation increases the absorption gradually moves towards the visible range, i.e. the compound becomes coloured.

The term resonance energy, though still widely used, is highly unsatisfactory on semantic grounds as it immediately conjures up visions of rapid oscillation between one structure and another, e.g. the Kekule structures, thus entirely misrepresenting the real state of affairs (cf. Pl9). The requirements necessary for the occurrence of aromatic stabilisa- tion, and character, in cyclic polyenes appear to be : (a) that the molecule should be flat (to allow of cyclic overlap of p orbitals); and (b) that all the bonding orbitals should be completely filled. This latter condition is fulfilled in cyclic systems with 4n + 2n electrons* (HuckeVs rule), and the arrangement that occurs by far the most commonly in aromatic compounds is when n = 1, i.e. that with 6n electrons.

A number of such factors have been recognised. 1.5.1 Inductive and field effects In a covalent single bond between unlike atoms, the electron pair forming the a bond is never shared absolutely equally between the two atoms; it tends to be attracted a little more towards the more electronegative atom of the two.

The effect of Ci on Cj is less than the effect of Cl on Cj , however, and the transmission quickly dies away in a saturated chain, usually being too small to be noticeable beyond C2 . These influences on the electron distribution in cr bonds are known as inductive effects. In addition to any inductive effect operating through the bonds in a compound, an essentially analogous effect can operate either through the space surrounding the molecule or, in solution, via the molecules of solvent that surround it. In many cases, however, it is not possible to distinguish between the operation of an inductive effect as such, and this closely similar (and parallel) field effect. Subsequently, reference to an inductive effect will, therefore, nor- mally be taken to include any such field effect. Most atoms and groups attached to carbon exert such inductive effects in the same direction as chlorine, i.e. they are electron-with- drawing, owing to their being more electronegative than carbon, the major exception being alkyl groups which are electron-donating.* Though the effect is quantitatively rather small, it is responsible for the increase in basicity that results when one of the hydrogen atoms of ammonia is replaced by an alkyl group (p. 66), and, in part at any rate, for the readier substitution of the aromatic nucleus in methylbenzene than in benzene itself (p. 153).

Mesomeric, like inductive, effects are permanent polarisations in the ground state of a molecule, and are therefore manifested in the physical properties of the compounds in which they occur. The essential difference between inductive and mesomeric effects is that while inductive effects can operate in both saturated and unsaturated compounds, mesomeric effects can operate only in unsaturated, especially in conjugated, compounds. The former involve the elec- trons in cr bonds, the latter those in v bonds and orbitals. Inductive effects are transmitted over only quite short distances in saturated chains before dying away, whereas mesomeric effects may be trans- mitted from one end to the other of quite large molecules provided that conjugation (i.e. delocalised tt orbitals) is present, through which they can proceed. 1.5.3 Time-variable effects Some workers have sought to distinguish between effects such as the two considered above, which are permanent polarisations manifested in the ground state of a molecule, and changes in electron distribution that may result either on the close approach of a reagent or, more especially, in the transition state (p. 38) that is formed from its initial attack. The time-variable factors, by analogy with the perma- nent effects discussed above, have been named the inductomeric and electromeric effects, respectively. Any such effects can be looked upon as polarisabilities rather than as polarisations, for the distribu- tion of electrons reverts to that of the ground state of the molecule attacked either if the reagent is removed without reaction being allowed to take place, or if the transition state, once reached, decomposes to yield the starting materials again. Such time-variable effects, being only temporary, will not, of course, be reflected in the physical properties of the compounds concerned.

They are considered in detail below (p. 313). 1.8 REACTION TYPES There are essentially four general types of reaction which organic compounds can undergo : (a) Displacement (substitution) (b) Addition (c) Elimination (d) Rearrangement In (a) it is displacement from carbon that is normally referred to, but the atom displaced can be either hydrogen or another atom or group.", "doc_name": "Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "page": 36, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Reaction Mechanism\\Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

Radical-induced displacement is also known, for example the halo- genation of alkanes (cf. p. 323).

Addition to simple carbon-carbon double bonds is normally either electrophile-, or radical-, induced; e.g. addition of HBr, \\ / c=c / \\ Br \\ 1 / C-C / I \\ H which can be initiated by the attack of either H® (p.l84) or Br- (p.317) on the double bond.

Highly exothermic reactions are known with only small equilibrium constants (little conversion of starting materials into products), and some reactions with large equilibrium constants are known that are actually endothermic (enthalpy of products higher than that of starting materials); clearly some factor in addition to enthalpy must be concerned in the relative stability of chemical species. That this should be so is a corollary of the Second Law of Thermo- dynamics which is concerned essentially with probabilities, and with the tendency for ordered systems to become disordered ; a measure of the de^ee of disorder of a system being provided by its entropy, S. In seeking their most stable condition, systems tend towards minimum energy (actually enthalpy, H) and maximum entropy (disorder or randomness), a measure of their relative stability must thus embrace a compromise between H and S, and is provided by the Gibb's free energy, G, which is defined by, G = H - TS where T is the absolute temperature. The free energy change during a reaction, at a particular temperature, is thus given by, AG = AH - TAS * H is a measure of the heat content, or enthalpy, of a compound, and AH is preceded by a minus sign if the products have a lower heat content than the starting materials ; when there is such a decrease in enthalpy the reaction is exothermic.", "doc_name": "Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "page": 40, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Reaction Mechanism\\Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}
{"text": "2.1 Energetics of reaction 35 and it is found that the change in free energy in going from starting materials to products, AG^ (AG^ refers to the change under standard conditions ; at unit activity ; less exactly at unit, i.e. molar, concentra- tion), is related to the equilibrium constant, K, for the change by the relation, -AG^= 2-303RTlogK i.e. the larger the decrease in free energy (hence, minus AG^) on going from starting materials to products, the larger the value of K, and the further over the equilibrium lies in favour of products. The position of minimum free energy thus corresponds to the attainment of equilibrium by starting materials/products. In a reaction for which there is no free energy change (AG^ = 0) K = 1, which corresponds to 50% conversion of starting materials into products. Increasing positive values of AG^ imply rapidly decreasing fractional values of K (the relationship is a logarithmic one), corresponding to ex- tremely little conversion into products, while increasing negative values of AG® imply correspondingly rapidly increasing values of K. Thus a AG® of -42 kJ (-10 kcal)mol ^ corresponds to an equilib- rium constant of »10’, and essentially complete conversion into products. A knowledge of the standard free energies of starting materials and of products, which have been measured for a large number of organic compounds, thus enables us to predict the expected extent of the conversion of the former into the latter. The AH factor for the change can be equated with the difference in energies between the bonds in the starting materials and the bonds in the products, and an approximate value of AH for a reaction can often be predicted from tables of standard bond energies; which is hardly unexpected, as it is from AH data that the average bond energies were compiled in the first place ! The entropy factor cannot be explained quite so readily, but effectively it relates to the number of possible ways in which their total, aggregate energy may be shared out among an assembly of molecules; and also to the number of ways in which an individual molecule’s quanta of energy may be shared out for translational, rotational, and vibrational purposes, of which the translational is likely to be by far the largest in magnitude. Thus for a reaction in which there is an increase in the number of molecular species on going from starting materials to products, A «=» B + C there is likely to be a sizeable increase in entropy because of the gain in translational freedom.

Our experimentally determined rate equation will give us information about the species that are involved up to and including the rate-limiting step of a reaction ; the rate equation does indeed specify the composition but not, other than by inference, the structure of the transition state for the rate-limiting step. It gives no direct information about intermediates nor, except by default as it were, about the species that are involved in rapid, non rate-limiting processes beyond this rate-limiting step. In considering the effect that a change of conditions, e.g. of solvent or in the structure of the starting material, might be expected to have on the rate of a reaction, we need to know what effect such changes will have on the stability (free energy level) of the transition state: any factors which serve to stabilise it will lead to its more rapid formation, and the opposite will also apply. It is seldom possible to obtain such detailed information about these high-energy transition states : the best we can commonly do is to take the relevant intermediates as models for them, and see what effect such changes might be expected to have on these. Such a model is not unreasonable: the transiently formed intermediate in Fig. 2.4 closely resembles, in terms of free energy level, the transition state that precedes it, and might be expected to resemble it in structure as well. Certainly such an intermediate is normally likely to be a better model for the transition state than the starting material would be. Thus <r complexes (Wheland intermediates) in aromatic electrophilic substitutions are used as models for the transition states that are their immediate precursors (p. 151).

Thus the nitration of methylbenzene is found to be kinetically controlled, whereas the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of the same species is often thermodynamically controlled (p. 163). The form of control that operates may also be influenced by the reaction condition, thus the sulphonation of naphthalene with con- centrated H 2SO4 at 80° is essentially kinetically controlled, whereas at 160° it is thermodynamically controlled (p. 164). 2.3 INVESTIGATION OF REACTION MECHANISMS It is seldom, if ever, possible to provide complete and entire information, structural, energetic, and stereochemical, about the pathway that is traversed by any chemical reaction; no reaction mechanism can ever be proved to be correct! Sufficient data can nevertheless usually be gathered to show that one or more theoretically possible mechanisms are just not compatible with the experimental results, and/or to demonstrate that of several remaining alternatives one is a good deal more likely than the others. 2.3.1 The nature of the products Perhaps the most fundamental information about a reaction is provided by establishing the structure of the products that are formed during its course, and relating this information to the structure of the starting material. Where, as is often the case with organic reactions, more than one product is obtained then it is usually an advantage to know also the relative proportions in which the products are obtained, e.g. in establishing, among other things, whether kinetic or thermodynamic control is operating(c/ p. 42). In the past this had to be done laboriously and often imprecisely—by manual isolation of the products, but may now often be achieved more easily, and precisely, by sophisticated chromatographic methods or, indirectly, by suitable spectroscopic ones The importance of establishing the correct structure of the reaction product is best illustrated by the confusion that can result when this has been assumed, wrongly, as self-evident, or established erroneously. Thus the yellow triphenylmethyl radical (3, cf p. 300), obtained from the action of silver on triphenylmethyl chloride in 1900, readily forms a colourless dimer (m.w. = 486) which was—reasonably enough—assumed to be hexaphenylethane (4) with thirty ‘aromatic’", "doc_name": "Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "page": 49, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Reaction Mechanism\\Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

Then again, if the hydrolysis in aqueous solution of the alkyl halide, RHal, is found to follow the rate equation. Rate = <c,[RHal] it is not necessarily safe to conclude that the rate-determining step does not involve the participation of water, simply on the grounds that [H 2O] does not appear in the rate equation; for if water is being used as the solvent it will be present in very large excess, and its concentration would remain virtually unchanged whether or not it actually partici- pated in the rate-limiting stage. The point could perhaps be settled by carrying out the hydrolysis in another solvent, e.g. HCO 2H, and by using a much smaller concentration of water as a potential nucleophile. The hydrolysis may then be found to follow the rate equation. Rate = <C2[RHal][HjO] but the actual mechanism of hydrolysis could well have changed on altering the solvent, so that we are not, of necessity, any the wiser about what actually went on in the original aqueous solution. The vast majority of organic reactions are carried out in solution, and quite small changes in the solvent used can have the profoundest effects on reaction rates and mechanisms. Particularly is this so when polar intermediates, for example carbocations or carbanions as constituents of ion pairs, are involved, for such species normally carry an envelope of solvent molecules about with them. This greatly affects their stability (and their ease of formation), and is strongly influenced by the composition and nature of the solvent employed, particularly its polarity and ion-solvating capabilities. By contrast, reactions that involve radicals (p. 299) are much less influenced by the nature of the solvent (unless this is itself capable of reacting with radicals), but are greatly influenced by the addition of radical sources (e.g. peroxides) or radical absorbers (e.g. quinones), or by light which may initiate reaction through the production of radicals by photochemical activa- tion, e.g. Br 2 Br- *Br.

If, for example the bond concerned is C— H, the question may be settled by comparing’ the rates of reaction, under the same conditions, of the compound in which we are interested, and its exact analogue in which this bond has been replaced by a C—D linkage. The two bonds will have the same chemical nature as isotopes of the same element are involved but their vi^bration frequencies, and hence their dissociation energies, will be slightly different because atoms of different mass are involved • the greater the mass, the stronger the bond. This difference in bond strength will of course, be reflected in different rates of breaking of the two bonds under comparable conditions: the weaker C—H bond being broken more rapidly than the stronger C—D bond; quantum- inechanical calculation suggests a maximum rate difference, ky^jk^.

Phenols are indeed found to be stronger acids than alcohols (the pK^ of phenol itself is 9-95) but considerably weaker than carboxylic acids. This is due to the fact that delocalisation o the negative charge in the carboxylate anion involves structures of identical energy content (see above), and of the centres involved two are hi^ly electronegative oxygen atoms; whereas in the phenoxide anion (2) the structures involving negative charge on the nuclear carbon atoms are likely to be of higher energy content than the one in which It IS on oxygen and, in addition, of the centres involved here only one is a highly electronegative oxygen atom.

{"text": "3.1.4 Simple aliphatic acids 57 water is a singularly effective ionising solvent on account (a) of its high dielectric constant (f = 80), and {b) of its ion-solvating ability. The first property exerts its effect because the higher the dielectric constant (polarity) of a solvent the lower the electrostatic energy of any pairs of ions present in it will be: the more readily will such ion pairs thus be formed, the more stable will they be in solution, and the less ready will they be, therefore, to recombine with each other. Ions in solution strongly polarise nearby solvent molecules, thereby collecting a solvation envelope of solvent molecules around them : the greater the extent to which this can take place, the greater the stabilisa- tion of the ion, which is in effect stabilising itself by spreading or delocalising its charge. The peculiar effectiveness of water, as an ion- solvating medium, arises from the fact that H 2O is extremely readily polarised, and also relatively small in size; because of this it can solvate, and thereby stabilise, both cations and anions. The effect is particularly marked with anions for powerful ‘hydrogen-bonded’ type solvation can occur (see below). Similar H-bonded typ)e solvation cannot in general occur with cations, but in the particular case of acids, the initial cation, H®, can also solvate through hydrogen bonding with the solvent water molecules : H HO H-OH ®/ 1 - H-Y + nHjO H-O + H -y® -H HO-H OH Alcohols, just SO long as they are not too bulky, e.g. MeOH, share something of water’s abilities and, for example, HCl is found to be a strong acid in methanol also. It should not, however, be forgotten that the prime requirement of the solvent is that it should capable of functioning as a base : the weaker the base, the smaller the dissociation of the acid. Thus we find that in, for example, methylbenzene (toluene) HCl occurs as such, i.e. it is almost wholly undissociated. 3,1.4 Simple aliphatic acids The replacement of the non-hydroxylic hydrogen atom of methanoic acid by an alkyl group might be expected to produce a weaker acid, as the electron-donating inductive effect of the alkyl group would reduce the residual electron affinity of the oxygen atom carrying the incipient proton, and so reduce the strength of the acid.

This is due to the fact that the unsaturated a-carbon atom is sp^ hybridised, which means that electrons are drawn closer to the carbon nucleus than in a saturated, sp hybridised atom due to the rather larger s contribution in the sp^ hybrid. The result is that sp^ hybridised carbon atoms are less electron-donating that saturated sp^ hybridised ones, and so propenoic acid though still weaker than methanoic acid is stronger than propanoic. The effect is much more marked with the sp* hybridised carbon ato^ of a triple bond, thus the pK„ of propynoic (propiolic) acid, HC=CC02H, is 1-84. An analogous situation occurs with the hydrogen atoms of ethene and ethyne; those of the former are little more acidic than the hydrogens in ethane, whereas those of ethyne are sufficiently acidic to be readily replaceable by a number of metals (c/ p. 272). 3.1.5 Sobstitiited aliphatic acids The effect of introducing electron-withdrawing substituents into simple aliphatic acids is more marked.

This arises from the substituent halogen atom effecting delocali- sation of the negative charge over the whole of the anion, e rCH3^C 0 oj the latter thus imposes correspondingly less powerful restriction on the water molecules surrounding it than does the unsubstituted ethanoate anion whose charge is largely concentrated, being confined substantially to CO^®. There is therefore a smaller decrease in entropy on ionisation of the halogen-substituted ethanoic acids than with ethanoic acid itself This is particularly pronounced with CFjCOjH (pK„ 0-23) for whose ionisation AG^= 1-3 kJ (0-3kcal) compared with 27-2 kJ (6-5kcal) for CH3CO2H, while the AH^ values for these two acids differ very little from each other.

A group with a more powerful (electron-withdrawing) inductive effect, e.g. NO2 , is found to have rather more influence.

{"text": "Nucleophilic substitution at a saturated carbon atom above, and this has been interpreted as involving the participation of both alkyl halide and hydroxyl ion in the rate-limiting (i.e. slowest) step of the reaction. Ingold has suggested a transition state in which the attacking hydroxyl ion becomes partially bonded to the reacting carbon atom before the incipient bromide ion has become wholly detached from it; thus part of the energy necessary to effect the breaking of the C— Br bond is then supplied by that produced in forming the HO—C bond. Quantum mechanical calculation shows that an approach by the hydroxyl ion along the line of centres of the carbon and bromine atoms is that of lowest energy requirement. This can be represented : H HO® + c- h\"/ H ( 1 ) Br H IC /\\ H H (2 ) Transition state H / HO-C + Br® V'H H The negative charge is spread in the transition state in the course of being transferred from hydroxyl to bromine, and the hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon atom attacked pass through a position in which they all lie in one plane (at right angles to the plane of the paper as drawn above). The initially sp^ hybridised carbon atom becomes sp^ hybridised in the transition state, the HO and Br being associated with the two lobes of the unhybridised p orbital that is thereby made available.

{"text": "4.1 Relation of kinetics to mechanism 19 This type of mechanism has been designated S^l: Substitution Nucleophilic unimolecular. The energy necessary to effect the initial ionisation is largely recovered from the energy evolved through solvation of the resultant ion pair. The entropy of activation, AS+, for such a dissociative process (c/. p. 39) is also advantageous; thus AS“'° for the hydrolysis of Mc 3CCl is found to be +51 JK ^ mol compared with -17 J mol“^ for hydrolysis of CH3CI. The cation in the ion pair (4), in which the central carbon atom carries the +ve charge, is of course a carbocation intermediate, and during its formation the initially sp^ hybridised carbon atom collapses to a more stable planar (sp^) state, in which the three methyl groups are as far apart from each other as they can get. Attack by ®OH or solvent (e.g. HjO:) can then take place from either side of this planar intermediate. If attainment of this planar state is inhibited by steric or other factors (cf. p. 87), the carbocation intermediate will be formed only with difficulty, if at all; i.e. ionisation, and hence reaction by the 8^,1 pathway, may then not take place. Thus the salient difference between reaction by the 8^2 and 8^,1 pathways is that 8^2 proceeds in one step only, via a transition state; while 8n 1 proceeds in t^ steps, via an actual (carbocation) intermediate. A certain element of confusion is to be met with both in textbooks, and in the literature, over the use and meaning of the terms order (cf. p. 39) and molecularity as applied to reactions. The order is an experimentally determined quantity, the overall order of a reaction being the sum of the powers of the concentration terms that appear in the rate equation ; Rate = fc3[A][B][C] Third order overall Rate = fc3[A]^[B] Third order overall Rate = fc2[A]^ Second order overall Generally, however, it is the order with respect to a particular reactant (or reactants) that is of more interest and significance than the overall order, i.e. that the above reactions are first order, second order, and second order, respectively, with respect to A. Examples of both zero order, and non-integral orders, with respect to a particular reactant are also known. The molecularity refers to the number of species (molecules, ions, etc.) that are undergoing bond-breaking and/or bond-making in one step of the reaction, usually in the rate-limiting step.

The molecularity of the reaction ^ a whole only has meaning if the reaction proceeds in a single step (an elementary reaction), as is believed to be the case with the hydrolysis of bromomethane above (p. 78); order and molecularity then coincide, the reaction being second order overall (first order in each reactant) and ^molecular. Order and molecularity do not always, or necessarily, have the same value, however. Simple kinetic measurements can, however, be an inadequate guide to which of the above two mechanisms, Sjyl or S^2 , is actually operating in, for example, the hydrolysis of a halide. Thus, as we have seen (p. 45), where the solvent can act as a nucleophile (solvolysis), e.g. HjO, we would expect for an Sjy2 type reaction. Rate = /c2[RHal][H20] but as [H 2O] remains effectively constant the rate equation actually observed will be. Rate = /c,„[RHal] and simple kinetic measurements in aqueous solution will thus suggest, erroneously, that the reaction is of the S^yl type. A kinetic distinction between the operation of the 8^,1 and 8^,2 modes can often be made by observing the effect on the overall reaction rate of adding a competing nucleophile, e.g. azide anion, Nj®. The total nucleophile concentration is thus increased, and for the 8^2 mode where [Nu:] appears in the rate equation, this will result in an increased reaction rate due to the increased [Nu:]. By contrast, for the 8 ;vl mode [Nu:] does not appear in the rate equation, i.e. is not involved in the rate-limiting step, and addition of N 3 ® will thus be without significant effect on the observed reaction rate, though it will naturally influence the composition of the product. 4.2 EFFECT OF SOLVENT Changing the solvent in which a reaction is carried out often exerts a profound effect on its rate and may, indeed, even result in a change in its mechanistic pathway. Thus for a halide that undergoes hydrolysis by the 8^1 mode, increase in the polarity of the solvent (i.e. increase in e, the dielectric constant) and/or its ion-solvating ability is found to result in a very marked increase in reaction rate. Thus the rate of solvolysis of the tertiary halide, MejCBr, is found to be 3 x 10^ times faster in 50% aqueous ethanol than in ethanol alone.

That such effects, particularly solvation, are of prime importance is borne out by the fact that Sjyl type reactions are extremely uncommon in the gas phase. For the S^2 mode, however, increasing solvent polarity is found to have a much less marked effect, resulting in a slight decrease in reaction rate.

A very marked effect on the rate of S^2 reactions is, however, effected on transferring them from polar hydroxylic solvents to polar non-hydroxylic solvents. Thus the reaction rate of the primary halide, Mel, with N3® at 0° increased 4-5 X lO'^-fold on transfer from methanol (e = 33) to N,N-dimethylmethanamide(dimethyl formamide, DMF), HCONMe2, with very much the same polarity (e = 37). This very large rate difference stems from the fact that the attacking nucleophile, Nj®, is highly solvated through hydrogen-bonding in MeOH (cf. p. 57) whereas it is very much less strongly solvated—and not by hydrogen- bonding—in HCONMez- The largely unsolvated N3® anion (in HCONMe2) is a very much more powerful nucleophile than when surrounded (as in MeOH) by a very much less nucleophilic solvation envelope, hence the rise in reaction rate. Rate increases of as much as 10^-fold have been observed on transferring S;y2 reactions from, e.g. MeOH, to another polar non-protic solvent, dimethyl sulphoxide (DM SO), Me2SO (t = 46).

This effect is probably small, and steric factors are of more importance; thus ®OH will find it progressively more difficult to attack the bromine-carrying carbon as the latter becomes more heavily substituted. More significantly, the resultant S;v2 transition state will have five groups around this carbon atom (compared with only four in the initial halide), there will thus be an increase in crowding on going from the initial halide to the transition state, and this relative crowding will increase as the size of the original substituents increases (H —* Me). The more crowded the T.S. relative to the starting materials, the higher its energy will be, and the slower therefore will it be formed. We would thus expect the purely 8^2 reaction rate to decrease as the above series is traversed. It is in fact possible to effect nucleophilic substitution (Br® -t- R—Cl) on a series of halides analogous to those in Fig. 4.1 (p. 82), under conditions such that a strictly second order rate equation (8^2 pathway) is followed throughout.

The relative contributions of hyperconjugation and inductive effects to the stabilisation of carbocations is open to debate, but it is significant that a number of carbocations will only form at all if they can take up a planar arrangement, the state in which hyperconjugation will operate most effectively {cf. p. 104). In steric terms there is a relief of crowding on going from the initial halide, with a tetrahedral disposition of four substituents about the sp^ hybridised carbon atom, to the carbocation, with a planar disposition of only three substituents (cf. five for the S;y2 T.S.) about the now sp^ hybridised carbon atom.

Similar carbocation stabilisation can also occur in the hydrolysis of allyl halides, e.g. 3-chloropropene: CH2=CH-CHjCI [CHj=CH-CHj CH2-CH=CHj] Cl® Sfjl attack is thus promoted and allyl, like benzyl, halides are normally more reactive than species, e.g. CH3CH2CH2CI and C6HSCH2CH2CH2CI, in which such carbocation stabilisation cannot take place. 8^,2 attack is also speeded up, compared with CH3CH2CH2CI, presumably because any electronic effect of the double bond—promoting reaction—is not here nullified by an ad- verse steric effect, as with the bulky CsHs group in C6H5CH2CI {cf. above). The proportion of the total reaction proceeding by each of the two pathways is found to depend on the conditions: more powerful nucleophiles promoting the 8^2 mode {cf. p. 96). By contrast, vinyl halides such as chloroethene, CHj^CHCl, and halogenobenzenes are very unreactive towards nucleophiles. This stems from the fact that the halogen atom is now bonded to an sp^ hybridised carbon, with the result that the electron pair of the C— Cl bond is drawn closer to carbon than in the bond to an sp^ hybri- dised carbon. The C—Q is found to be stronger, and thus less easUy broken, than in, for example, CH3CH2CI, and the C—Q dipole is smaller; there is thus less tendency to ionisation (8;^!) and a less positive carbon for ®OH to attack (8;y2); the n electrons of the double bond also inhibit the close approach of an attacking nucleophile. The double bond would not help to stabilise either the 8^2 transition state or the carbocation involved in the 8^1 pathway. Very much the same considerations apply to halogenobenzenes, with their sp^ hybridised carbons and the tt orbital system of the benzene nucleus; their reactions, which though often bimolecular are not in fact simply 8iv2 in nature, are discussed further below (p. 170).

Any differences in electronic effect of the Me groups through two saturated carbon atoms would be very small, and the reason for the rate differences is steric: increased difficulty of approach of EtO® ‘from the back’ of the carbon atom carrying Br, and increased crowding in the resultant T.S. The reason for the particularly large drop in rate between l-bromo-2-methylpropane (14) and l-bromo-2,2-dimethylpropane(neopentyl bromide, 15) is that the T.S. for the former, thou^ somewhat crowded, can, by rotation about the C^—Cf bond, adopt one conformation (14a) in which the attacking EtO® is interfered with only by H, while no such relief of crowding is open in the T.S.

{"text": "88 Nucleophilic substitution at a saturated carbon atom It will be seen that the spatial arrangement of the three residual groups attached to the carbon atom attacked has been effectively turn^ inside out. The carbon atom is said to have undergone inversion of its configuration (the arrangement in space of the groups attached to it). Indeed, if the product could be the bromide, instead of, as here, the corresponding alcohol, it would be found to rotate the plane of polarisation of plane polarised light in the opposite direction, i.e. ( — ), to the starting material, (+), for it would, of course, be its mirror image {cf. p. 89). The actual product is the alcohol, however, and we are unfortunately not able to tell, merely by observing its direction of optical rotation, whether it has the same or the opposite configuration to the bromide from which it was derived: compounds, other than mirror images, that have opposite configurations do not necessarily exhibit opposite directions of optical rotation, while compounds that have the same configuration do not necessarily exhibit the same direc- tion of optical rotation. Thus in order to confirm that the above S,y2 reaction is, in practice, attended by an inversion of configuration, as theory requires, it is necessary to have an independent method for relating the configuration of starting material and product, e.g. the bromide and corresponding alcohol above. 4.4.2 Determination of relative configuration This turns essentially on the fact that if a chiral compound undergoes a reaction in which a bond joining one of the groups to the chiral centre is broken, then the centre may—though it need not of necessity undergo inversion of configuration ; while if the compound undergoes reaction in which no such bond is broken then the chiral centre will preserve its configuration intact.

Reaction of this ester (21) with MeC02® is known to be a displacement in which ArSO,® (Ar = p-MeCgH4 ) is expelled and MeCOj® introduced,* hence the C—O bond is broken in this reaction, and inversion of configuration can thus take place in forming the acetate (22) . Alkaline hydrolysis of the acetate (22 —> 23) can be shown not to involve fission of the alkyl-oxygen C—O linkage,! so the alcohol (23) must have the same configuration as the acetate (22). As (23) is found to be the mirror image of the starting material (20)—opposite direction of optical rotation—an inversion of configuration must have taken place during the series of reactions, and can have occurred only during reaction of MeCOj® with the tosylate (21). Reaction of this tosylate (21) with a number of nucleophiles showed that inversion of configuration occurred in each case: it may thus be concluded with some confidence that it occurs on reaction with Br® to yield the bromide (24), i.e. that the bromide (24), like the acetate (22), has the opposite configuration to the original alcohol (20). The general principle—that bimolecular (S^2) displacement reac- tions are attended by inversion of configuration—was established in an elegant and highly ingenious experiment, in which an optically active alkyl halide undergoes displacement by the same—though isotopically labelled—halide ion as nucleophile, e.g. radioactive '^®I® on ( -h )2-iodooctane (25): QH,3 wsje + C_1 H (25) a- 128 j.

The rate of displacement and of inversion are thus identical within the limits of experimental error, and it thus follows that each act of bimolecular displacement must thus proceed with inversion of con- figuration.

In practice, however, the expected racemisation—and nothing but racemisation—is rarely observed, it is almost always accompanied by some degree of inversion. The relative proportions of the two are found to depend on : (a) the structure of the halide, in particular the relative stability of the carbocation to which it can give rise; and (b) the solvent, in particular on its ability as a nucleophile. The more stable the carbocation, the greater is the proportion of racemisation; the more nucleophilic the solvent, the greater is the proportion of inversion.

{"text": "4.4.4 The mechanistic borderline 91 Here (26) is an intimate ion pair in which the jointly solvated gegen- ions are in very close association with no solvent molecules between them, (27) is a solvent-separated ion pair, and (28) represents the now dissociated, and separately solvated, pair of ions. In a solvolysis reaction, attack on R® by a solvent molecule, e.g. HjO:, in (26) is likely to lead to inversion, as attack can take place (by the solvent envelope) on the ‘back’ side of R®, but not on the ‘front’ side where there are no solvent molecules, and which is shielded by the Br® gegen ion. Attack in (27) is more likely to lead to attack from either side, leading to racemisation, while attack on (28) can clearly happen with equal facility from either side. Thus the longer the life of R®, i.e. the longer it escapes nucleophilic attack, the greater the proportion of racemisation that we should expect to occur. The life of R® is likely to be longer the more stable it is—(a) above—but the shorter the more powerfully nucleophilic the solvent (b) above. Thus solvolysis of ( + )C 6H 5CHMeCl, which can form a stabilised benzyl type carbocation (cf. p. 84), leads to 98% racemisation while ( + )C 6H, 3CHMeCl, where no comparable stabilisation can occur, leads to only 34% racemisation. Solvolysis of ( + )C6HjCHMeCl in 80 % acetone/20 % water leads to 98 % racemisation (above), but in the more nucleophilic water alone to only 80% racemisation. The same general considerations apply to nucleophilic displacement reactions by Nu: as to solvolysis, except that R® may persist a little further along the sequence because part at least of the solvent envelope has to be stripped away before Nu: can get at R®. It is important to notice that racemisation is clearly very much less of a stereochemical requirement for S^rl reactions than inversion was for S^r2. 4.4.4 The mechanistic borderline Reference has already been made (p. 82) to the fact that the reactions of some substrates, e.g. secondary halides, may follow a mixed first/second order rate equation. The question then arises whether such a reaction is proceeding via both 8^2 and 8^1 pathways simultaneously (their relative proportions depending on the solvent, etc.) or whether it is proceeding via some specific, ‘in between’ mechanistic pathway. In solvolytic reactions like those we have just been considering, where the solvent itself is the nucleophile, such mixed kinetics may not be detectable, irrespective of what is actually happening, as both 8n 1 and 8^2 pathways are likely to follow a rate equation of the form; Rate = fc[R—X] This is so because in the 8^2 pathway the concentration of nuc- leophile will remain essentially constant throughout the reaction as—being also the solvent—it is present in very large, unchanging", "doc_name": "Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "page": 97, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Reaction Mechanism\\Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

{"text": "92 Nucleophilic substitution at a saturated carbon atom excess. This raises the question whether the mixture of racemisation/inversion observed in such cases stems from the simul- taneous operation of S^l and 8^2 pathways for solvolysis, rather than via the relatively elaborate, variable ion pair hypothesis ad- vanced above. In some cases at least it is possible to demonstrate that a ‘mixed’ Sn 1 + Sn2 pathway is not operating.

Adding the much more powerfully nucleophilic MeC02® (as MeC02®Na®) to the reaction mixture was found to result in: (a) no increase in the overall reaction rate, and (b) no increase in the proportion of net inversion. This strongly suggests that the inversion that is observed does not stem from part of the overall reaction proceeding via an 8^2 pathway simultaneously with the (major) 8^1 mode. If it did, we would expect the change to a much more powerful nucleophile (MeC02H —> MeC02®) to load to marked increases in both (a) and (h) above. A good deal of interest, and controversy, has centred on whether in the last analysis there is perhaps a continuous spectrum of mechanistic pathways intermediate between 8^2 and 8^ 1 : these imperceptibly shading into each other via gradually varying trans- ition states from the pure 8^2 side, and via gradually varying ion pair/solvent combinations from the pure 8^1 side. It is an area in which theory has shaded over into semantics if, indeed, not even into theology! 4.4.5 Sjyi mechanism: retention of configuration Despite what has been said above about displacement reactions leading to inversion of configuration, to racemisation, or to a mixture of both, a number of cases are known of reactions that proceed with actual retention of configuration, i.e. in which the starting material and product have the same configuration.

Provided collapse of the ion pair to products then occurs rapidly, i.e. in the intimate ion pair (33) within a solvent cage (cf. p. 90), then attack by Cl® is likely to occur on the same side of R® from which ®OSOCl departed, i.e. with retention of configura- tion: .c-osci Ph7 H (31) slow .

In an S^2 displacement, however, the more strongly nucleo- philic the reagent the more the reaction will be promoted. The nucleo- philicity of a reagent might perhaps be expected to correlate with its basicity, as both involve the availability of electron pairs and the ease with which they are donated. The parallel is by no means exact, however, in that basicity involves electron pair donation to hydrogen, whereas nucleophilicity involves electron pair donation to another atom, very often carbon ; basicity involves an equilibrium (thermodynamic), i.e. AG^, situation, whereas nucleophilicity usually involves a kinetic, i.e. AG*, one; basicity is likely to be little affected by steric influences, whereas nucleophilicity may be markedly affected. This distinction follows to some extent the recently introduced one between hard and soft bases : a hard base is one in which the donor atom is of high electronegativity, low polarisability, and is hard to oxidise, i.e. ®OH, ®OR, R 3N: ; while a soft base is one in which the donor atom is of low electronegativity, high polarisability, and is easy to oxidise, e.g. RS®, I®, SCN®; for a given degree of basicity, softness promotes nucleophilicity. Basicity data are often the more readily avaUable, however, and can be used as a guide to nucleophilicity provided like is being compared with like. Thus if the attacking atom is the same (cf. electronegativity above), then the two run reasonably in parallel, and we find the stronger the base the more powerful the nucleophile; EtO® > PhO® > MeCOj® > NO3® A shift in mechanistic type can also occur with change of nucleophile, thus a displacement that is 8^,1 with, for example, H 2O:, HCO 3 ®, MeCOj®, etc., may become Sn2 with ®OH or EtO®. Nucleophilicity is found to be very much affected by the size of the attacking atom in the nucleophile, at least for comparisons within", "doc_name": "Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "page": 102, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Reaction Mechanism\\Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

This AgCN/NaCN dichotomy has long been exploited preparatively. Similarly, nitrite ion [NO2]® is found to result in the formation of alkyl nitrites, R—O—N=0, under S^fl conditions (O is the atom of higher electron density) and nitroalkanes, R—NOj, under Sf/2 conditions (N is the more readily polarisable atom). 4.5.2 The leaving group Changing the leaving group will clearly alter the rate of both S^l and S^2 reactions, as breaking the bond to the leaving group is involved in the slow, rate-limiting step of both. We might expect the relative ability of Y as a leaving group, in R—Y, to be influenced by: (a) the strength of the R—Y bond; (b) the polarisability of this bond; (c) the stability of Y®; and (related to the latter) (d) the degree of stabilisation, through solvation, of the forming Y® in the T.S. for either 8^,1 or S^2. The observed reactivity (8^2 or 8^1) sequence for halides R— 1 > R— Br > R—Cl > R-F suggests that here (a) and (b) above are probably more important than (c) and (d). For a wider range of potential leaving groups, involvement of (c) would suggest that the weaker Y® is as a base (or the stronger H—Y is as an acid) the better a leaving group it will be. This is borne out to some extent over a series of leaving groups in which the atom in Y through which it is attached to R remains the same. Thus the anions of strong ‘oxygen acids’ such as p- MeC6H4803® (tosylate, cf. p. 88), CF38O3® (triflate) are good leaving groups (as indeed are halide anions); with such O-leaving groups, (c) and (d) above are of increased importance. Relative leaving group ability may however vary with change of solvent, reflecting the influence of (d). This variation in relative ability can be particularly marked on changing from a hydroxylic solvent to a bipolar, non-protic one (e.g. Mc280, HCONMc2, etc.) as initial (c)/(d) domination may then shift to (a)/(b) control.

{"text": "4.6 Other nucleophilic displacements 99 This is known as nucleophilic catalysis. The stronger, and harder, as a base a leaving group is, the less readily can it be displaced; thus groups such as ®OH, ®OR, ®NHz bonded to carbon by small, highly electronegative atoms of low polarisability (c/. hard bases, above) cannot normally be displaced directly by other nucleophiles. Displacements that are otherwise difficult, or even impossible, to accomplish directly may sometimes be effected by modification of the potential leaving group—often through protonation—so as to make it weaker, and/or softer, as a base. Thus ®OH cannot be displaced directly by Br®, but is displaced readily if protonated first : Br® + R-OH Br-R + ®OH H-ir Br® + R-OH -» Br-R + HjO it There are two main reasons for this : (a) Br® is now attacking a positively charged, as opposed to a neutral, species, and (b) the very weakly basic HjO is a very much better leaving group than the strongly basic ®OH.

The particular stability of McjC® is borne out by the fact that it may often be formed, under vigorous conditions, by the isomerisation of other first-formed carbocations (cf. p. 102), and also by the observation that it remained unchanged after heating at 170° in SbFs/FSOsH for four weeks! An essential requirement for such stabilisation is that the carboca- tion should be planar, for it is only in this configuration that effective delocalisation can occur. Quantum mechanical calculations for simple alkyl cations do indeed suggest that the planar (sp^) configuration is more stable than the pyramidal (sp^) by —84 kJ (20 kcal) mol~^. As planarity is departed from, or its attainment inhibited, instability of the cation and consequent difficulty in its formation increases very rapidly. This has already been seen in the extreme inertness of 1-bromotriptycene (p. 87) to S^l attack, due to inability to assume the planar configuration preventing formation of the carbocation. The expected planar structure of even simple cations has been confirmed by analysis of the n.m.r. and i.r. spectra of species such as Me 3C®SbFe®; they thus parallel the trialkyl borons, R3B, with which they are isoelectronic.

This suggests very close association of the migrating group, R, with the migration terminus before it has completely severed its connection with the migration origin ; we should thus expect no opportunity for its configuration to change, i.e. retention of configuration in a chiral R* group.

The fact that the rearrangement of ArCONH2 is speeded up when Ar contains electron-donating substituents (cf. the pinacol/pinacolone rearrangement, p. 115), and that the formation of hydroxamic acids, RCONHOH (that would be expected from attack of solvent H2O on RCON), has never been detected, both support a concerted mechanism.

The Curtius and Schmidt reactions both involve N 2 as the leaving group from the azide intermediate (67), and here again the migration of R occurs in a concerted process. The azide may be obtained either by nitrosation of an acid hydrazide (65)—Curtius reaction—or by the reaction of hydrazoic acid, HN3, on a carboxylic acid (66)—the Schmidt reaction. 5.6.2 Beckmann rearrangements The most famous of the rearrangements in which R migrates from carbon to nitrogen is undoubtedly the conversion of ketoximes to", "doc_name": "Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "page": 129, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Reaction Mechanism\\Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

Only a very few aldoximes rearrange under these conditions, but more can be made to do so by use of polyphosphoric acid as catalyst. Perhaps the most interesting feature of the rearrangement is that, unlike those we have already considered, it is not the nature (e.g. relative electron- releasing ability) but the stereochemical arrangement of the R and R' groups that determines which of them migrates.

A number of intermediate esters (73fe) have indeed been prepared independently and shown to undergo rearrangement to the expected amides, in the absence of added catalysts and in neutral solvents. The stronger the acid XOH is, i.e. the more capable the anion is of independent existence, the better leaving group XO® should be and hence the faster the rearrangement should occur. This is observed in the series where XO® is CH3CO2® < CICH2CO2® < PhS03®. That such ionisation is the rate-limiting step in the rearrangement is also suggested by the observation that the rate of reaction increases as the solvent polarity increases. As with the rearrangements we have discussed previously, loss of leaving group and migration of R are believed to proceed essentially simultaneously in the conversion of (73) into (74). This is borne out by the strict intramolecularity of the reaction (no crossover products, cf. p. 116), the high stereoselectivity already referred to (i.e. only R, not R' migrates), and the fact that R, if chiral, e.g. PhCHMe, retains its configuration on migration.

Further, a chiral R is found to migrate with its con- figuration unchanged. When an unsymmetrical ketone, RCOR', is oxidised either group could migrate, but it is found in practice that it is normally the more nucleophilic group, i.e. the group better able to stabilise a positive charge, that actually migrates, cf. the pinacol/ pinacolone rearrangement (p. 115).

This is because there are two factors operating in (2) that serve to reduce the energy barrier that has to be surmounted in order to effect its formation: first, the energy liberated by the complete formation of the new bond to the attacking electrophile, and, second, the fact that the positively charged a complex can stabilise itself, i.e. lower its energy level, by delocalisation H D (2 ) as has indeed been implied by writing its structure as (2). The use of (2) should not, however, be taken to imply a uniform distribution of electron density in the ion—that this could not be so is plain when the separate canonical structures (2a, 2b and 2c, p. 132) contribut- ing to (2) are written out. Ifwe are correct in our assumption that the electrophilic substitution of aromatic species involves such a complexes as intermediates—and it has proved possible actually to isolate them in the course of some such substitutions (p. 136)—then what we commonly refer to as aromatic ‘substitution’ really involves initial addition followed by subsequent elimination. How this basic theory is borne out in the common electrophilic substitution reactions of benzene will now be considered. 6.2 NITRATION The aromatic substitution reaction that has received by far the closest study is nitration and, as a result, it is the one that probably provides the most detailed mechanistic picture. Preparative nitration is most frequently carried out with a mixture of concentrated nitric and sulphuric acids, the so-called nitrating mixture.

{"text": "134 Electrophilic and nucleophilic substitution in aromatic systems and so prevents the reverse reaction from proceeding. This explanation is unsatisfactory in a number of respects, not least in that nitro- benzene, once formed, appears not to be attacked by water under the conditions of the reaction ! What is certain is that nitration is slow in the absence of sulphuric acid, yet sulphuric acid by itself has virtually no effect on benzene under the conditions normally employed. It would thus appear that the sulphuric acid is acting on the nitric acid rather than the benzene in the system. This is borne out by the fact that solutions of nitric acid in pure sulphuric acid show an almost four-fold molecular freezing-point depression (actually i % 3 -82 ), which has been interpreted as being due to formation of the four ions: HO-NOj HjO-!-NOj i=zz^ H3O® + HSO4® + ®N03 + HSO4® i.e. HNO3 + 2H3S04^jrr*®N02 + H3O® + 2HSO4® The slight shortfall of 1 below 4 is probably due to incomplete protona- tion of HjO under these conditions. The presence of ®N02, the nitronium ion, both in this solution and in a number of salts (some of which, e.g. ®N02 CIO4®, have actually been isolated) has been confirmed spectroscopically; there is a line in the Raman spectrum of each of them at 1400 cm” ‘ which can only originate from a species that is both linear and triatomic. Nitric acid itself is converted in concentrated sulphuric acid virtually entirely into ®N02 , and there can be little doubt left that this is the effective electro- phile in nitration under these conditions. If the purpose of the sulphuric acid is merely to function as a highly acid medium in which ®N02 can be released from HO—NO2, it would be expected that other strong acids, e.g. HCIO4, would also promote nitration. This is indeed found to be the case, and HF plus BF3 are also effective. The poor performance of nitric acid by itself in the nitration of benzene is thus explained for it contains but little ®N02 ; the small amount that is present is obtained by the two-stage process HO-NO2 + HNO3 HjO-NOj + NO3® O slow H3O-NO3 + HNO3 f± H3O® + NO3® + ®NO, in which nitric acid is first converted rapidly into its conjugate acid, and that then more slowly into ®N02.

{"text": "6.2 Nitration 135 the overall nitration reaction. That ®N02^ once formed, is a highly effective nitrating agent is borne out by the rapid nitration that may be effected, of even relatively unreactive aromatic species, by the salt ®N02Bp4 ® at room temperature or below. Many nitration reactions with nitrating mixture are, however, found to follow an ‘idealised’ rate equation of the form. Rate = fc[Ar-H][®NOj] but, in practice, the actual kinetics are not always easy to follow or to interpret for a variety of reasons. Thus the solubility of, for example, benzene itself in nitrating mixture is sufficiently low for the rate of nitration to be governed by the rate at which the immiscible hydro- carbon dissolves in the acid layer. With nitrating mixture, [®N02] is related directly to [HNO3] added, as HNO3 is converted rapidly and completely into ®N02 , but with nitrations in other solvents complex equilibria may be set up. The relation of the concentration of the effective electrophile (nearly always NO2®) to the concentration of HNO3, or other potential nitrating agent, actually added may then be far from simple. The above general, idealised rate law is compatible with at least three different potential pathways for nitration: one-step, concerted pathway [1] that involves a single transition state (5), d+ d + (5) in which C—NO 2 bond-formation and C—H bond-breaking are occurring simultaneously; or two-step pathways [2] involving a Wheland intermediate or a complex (6), (6) in which either step (a)— C—NO2 bond-formation—or step (b) C—H bond-breaking—could be slow and rate-limiting. The C— H bond must, of course, be broken at some stage in all three of the above pathways, but a partial distinction between them is that it must be broken in the slow, rate-limiting step in [1] (only one step, anyway) and in [2b], but not in [2a].

This has been shown to be due to the presence of nitrous acid in the system which nitrosates the reactive nucleus via the nitrosonium ion, ®NO (or other species capable of effecting nitrosation, cf p. 120): HNOj + 2HNO3 ^ H3O® + 2NO3® + ®NO (9 ) ( 10 ) ( 11 )", "doc_name": "Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "page": 143, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Reaction Mechanism\\Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}
{"text": "138 Electrophilic and nucleophilic substitution in aromatic systems The nitrosophenol (10), which may be isolated, is oxidised very rapidly by nitric acid to yield the p-nitrophenol ( 11 ) and nitrous acid; more nitrous acid is produced thereby and the process is progressively speeded up. No nitrous acid need be present initially in the nitric acid for a little of the latter attacks phenol oxidatively to yield HNO2 . The rate-determining step is again believed to be the formation of the intermediate (9). Some direct nitration of such reactive aromatic compounds by ®N02 also takes place simul- taneously, the relative amount by the two routes depending on the conditions. Many other aromatic electrophilic substitution reactions are found to follow the general pathway [2 ] discussed above, usually correspond- ing to [2a] though a number of [2b] examples are known. The major point still requiring elucidation is very often the exact nature of the electrophilic species that is involved in attack on the aromatic nucleus. 6.3 HALOGENATION In contrast to nitration, halogenation can involve a variety of different electrophiles in attack on the aromatic system. The free halogens, e.g. CI2 and Br2 , wUl readily attack an activated nucleus (cf. p. 150) such as phenol, but are unable to substitute benzene itself (photochemical activation can lead to addition, however, through the agency of free halogen atoms, p. 316): a Lewis acid catalyst such as AICI3 is required to assist in polarising the attacking halogen molecule, thereby providing it with an ‘electrophilic end’; the energy required to form Cl® is prohibitive. The rate equation found is often of the form: Rate = /c[Ar—H][Hal 2 ] [Lewis acid] It seems likely that benzene forms a n complex (12) with, for example, Br2 {cf. p. 131), and that the Lewis acid then interacts with this. The catalyst probably polarises Br— Br, assists in the formation of a a bond between the bromine molecule’s now electrophilic end and a ring carbon atom, and finally helps to remove the incipient bromide ion so as to form a <r complex (13): (12) FeBr4® + HBr -t- FeBrj ( 13 ) The anion FeBr^® assists in the removal of a proton from the <r complex (13).

What is found in practice is that substitution occurs so as to yield either predominantly the m-isomer, or pre- dominantly a mixture of o- and p-isomers; in the former case the overall rate of attack is always slower than on benzene itself, in the latter case the overall rate of attack is usually faster than on benzene itself. The major controlling influence is found to be exerted by Y, the substituent already present, and this can be explained in detail on the basis of the electronic effects that Y can exert. It can, of course, also exert a steric effect, but the operation of this factor is confined essentially to attack at the o-position ; this influence will be discussed separately below (p. 159). Substituents, Y, are thus classed as being m-, or o-/p-directing; if they induce faster overall attack than on benzene itself they are said to be activating, if slower, then deactivating.

The transition state for which (41) is taken as a model will thus be at a lower energy level than those corresponding to (40) and (42); its free energy of activation (AG’*’) will be lower and it will therefore be formed more rapidly: the m -isomer will thus predominate in the reaction product. Where the positive charge on the atom adjacent to the nucleus is real rather than formal, i.e. ®NR 3 rather than NO 2 , there is evidence that its effect on a complex stability is exerted through a field effect {cf. p. 22) operating through space, in addition to any polar (induc- tive) effect operating through the bonds.

There is found to be very close agreement between calculation and n.m.r. data for the distribution of +ve charge—p-> o-»m—around the ring in the cyclohexadienyl cation (57), which is the Wheland intermediate for proton exchange in benzene (c/. p. 133): (57) On this basis an electron-donating substituent, Y, should be some- what better at promoting attack by H® p-(57a, R = H), rather than o-(576, R = H), to Y because of the slightly more effective delocal- isation of +ve charge that thereby results. TTie figures quoted in (57) would point to an expected value for the log partial rate ratio, log /o-/log /p-. of =0-87, and values very close to this have indeed been observed for protonation of a number of different CgHjY species.

This can be accounted for by the more effective delocalisation, and hence stabilisation, that can take place in the Wheland intermediate for 1 - attack (60a *-> 60b) compared with that for 2-attack (61): More forms can also be written in each case in which the positive charge is now delocalised over the second ring, leading to a total of seven forms for the 1 -intermediate as against six for the 2-, but the above, in which the second ring retains intact, fully delocalised n orbitals, are probably the most important and the contrast, between two contributing forms in the one case and one in the other, corres- pondingly more marked.

The greater stability of the 2-acid stems from the ^stabilising effect, in the 1-acid, of steric interaction between the very bulky SO3H and the H atom in the adjacent 8-position; the 1- and 3-H atoms, in the 2-acid, are both further away. The interconversion of 1- and 2-acids in H2SO4 at 160° could result either from a direct intramolecular isomerisation, or by reversal of sulphonation to yield naphthalene which undergoes new attack at the other position. It should be possible to distinguish between these alternatives by carrying out the reaction in H2^*S04, for the former should lead to no incorporation of in the product sulphonic acids, whereas the latter should lead to such incorporation. Experimentally it is found that incorporation of does take place but at a rate slower than that at which the conversion occurs. This could imply either that both routes are operative simultaneously, or that, after reversal of sulphonation, new attack takes place on the resultant naphthalene by the departing H2SO4 molecule faster than by surround- ing H2^*S04 molecules—the question is still open. Pyridine (62), like benzene, has six n electrons (one being supplied by nitrogen) in delocalised n orbitals but, unlike benzene, the orbitals will be deformed by being attracted towards the nitrogen atom because of the latter’s being more electronegative than carbon. This is reflected in the dipole of pyridine, which has the negative end on N and the positive end on the nucleus : ^ = 2-3 D (62) Pyridine is thus referred to as a n-deficient heterocycle and, by analogy with a benzene ring that carries an electron-withdrawing substituent, e.g. NO2 (p. 151), one would expect it to be deactivated towards electrophilic attack. Substitution takes place, with difficulty, at the 3-position because this leads to the most stable Wheland intermediate (63); the intermediates for 2- and 4-attack (64 and 65, respectively) each has a canonical state in which the © charge is located on divalent N—a highly unstable, i.e. high energy, state ; H E (63) (64) (65)", "doc_name": "Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "page": 171, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Reaction Mechanism\\Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

Thus nitration, chlorination, bromination and Friedel- Crafts reactions cannot really be made to take place usefully, and sulphonation only occurs on heating with oleum for 24 hours at 230°, with an Hg^® catalyst. This difficulty of attack is due partly to the fact that pyridine has an available electron pair on nitrogen, and can thus protonate (66), or interact with an electrophile (67): E (66) (67) The positive charge will clearly further destabilise any of the a complexes for electrophilic substitution, as did a substituent such as ®NR 3 on the benzene nucleus (p. 152), but the destabilisation will be much more marked than with ®NRj as the © charge is now on an atom of the ring itself and not merely on a substituent. Pyrrole (68) also has (m electrons in delocalised n orbitals, but here the nitrogen atom has to contribute two electrons to make up the six (thus becoming essentially non-basic in the process, cf. p. 73), and the dipole of pyrrole is found to be in the opposite direction to that of pyridine, i.e. with the positive end on nitrogen and the negative end on the nucleus : + H ;/ = 1-8 D (68) Pyrrole is thus referred to as a n-excessive heterocycle and behaves rather like a reactive benzene derivative, e.g. aniline (p. 153), undergoing very ready electrophilic attack.

H® is a poor leaving group (contrast the very much better leaving group H® in electrophilic attack) so the equilibrium tends to lie over to the left—®OH, being a better leaving group, is lost a lot more often than H®—unless an oxidising agent, e.g. air, KNO3, or K3pe(CN)g, is present to encourage the elimination of hydride ion, and to destroy it as formed.

{"text": "172 Electrophilic and nucleophilic substitution in aromatic systems 2,4-Dinitrofluorobenzene (86, X = F) is, because of its reactivity, much used for ‘tagging’ the NH2 group of terminal amino-acids in protein end group analysis. Once it has reacted with the NH2 it is very difficult to remove again and will thus withstand the subsequent hydrolysis of the protein to its constituent amino-acids. Such rate difference as there is for attack on (86) depends on the ability of X, through electron-withdrawal, to influence the relative ease of attack on the substrate by the nucleophile: it is in the reverse order of the relative ability of the halide ions as leaving groups. When the same series of halides is reacted with CeHsNHMe (in nitrobenzene at 120'’), however, the relative rates for X = F, Cl and Br were found to be 1, 15 and 46, e.g. in the order of their relative ability as leaving groups, so that in this latter reaction it would appear that step (2) is now involved, to some extent at least, in the rate-limiting step overall. The first pathway above is much the more common, however, and we can add it [S^,2(aromatic)]—bond-breaking by the leaving group after bond-formation to the nucleophile—to the S^2—bond-breaking by the leaving group and bond-formation to the nucleophile simultane- ous—and the S^l—bond-breaking by the leaving group before bond- formation to the nucleophile—pathways that we have already en- countered. Thus nucleophilic aromatic ‘substitution’ is in fact an addition/elimination process very similar to electrophilic aromatic ‘substitution’, except for the different attacking species. Other important examples of nucleophilic aromatic substitutions of preparative signi- ficance are the displacement of SOj^® from the alkali-metal salts of sulphonic acids, e.g. ArS03 ®Na®, by ®OH and ®CN and, less importantly, the displacement of ®NR 2 from p-nitroso-N,N-dialkyl- anilines by ®OH. Significant electron-withdrawal by a substituent to stabilise the anionic intermediate, e.g. (81), only occurs through a mesomeric effect, i.e. when the nitro group, for example, is o- and/or p- to the leaving group. Thus we observe the reactivity sequence : NOj NOj NOj 2- and 4-, but not 3-, halogenopyridines undergo ready nucleophilic displacement reactions for exactly the same reason. Mesomeric interaction with an electron-withdrawing substituent will be reduced or inhibited if the p orbital on the atom adjacent to the nucleus, e.g. N in NO 2 , is prevented from becoming parallel to the p orbital on the nuclear carbon to which it is attached (steric inhibition of delocalisa- tion, cf p. 71).

Formation of (9) usually appears to be the rate-limiting step of the reaction. The suggestion of cyclic bromonium ions as intermediates, to account for the highly stereoselective (ANTI) addition often ob- served with simple acyclic alkenes, was made as long ago as 1938. Evidence supporting the existence of such intermediates has come from a number of different fields; thus it has proved possible to detect one by physical methods using the ‘super’ acids of Olah (p. 102) and n.m.r. spectroscopy. Thus reaction of the 1,2-dibromide (11) with SbFj in liquid SO2 at -60° led to the formation of an ion pair, but this exhibited not the tw^ signal (one from each of two different groups of six equivalent protons) n.m.r. spectrum expected of (12).

{"text": "182 Electrophilic and nucleophilic addition to C=C The degree of ANTI stereoselectivity exhibited in the addition of halogens to alkenes will clearly depend on the relative stability, under the reaction conditions, of any cyclic halonium ion intermediate, e.g. (9a), compared with the corresponding carbocationic intermediate, e.g. (12). Thus, because of the higher electronegativity of chlorine than bromine, with corresponding reluctance to share its electron pairs, it might be expected that with some alkenes the addition of chlorine would be less stereoselective than that of bromine: this is found to be the case. It might also be expected that structural features leading to specific stabilisation of carbocations, might also lead to less ANTI stereoselectivity; this is observed with, for exam- ple, trans 1-phenylpropene (15): 30% SYN addition 70% ANTI addition (15) (16) The possible formation of a delocalised benzyl type carbocation ( 16) results in much lower (70%) ANTI stereoselectivity than with trans 2-butene (5; =100% ANTI stereoselectivity, p. 180), where no such delocalisation is possible. It is also found that increasing the polar- ity, and ion-solvating ability, of the solvent also stabilises the carbocation, relative to the bromium ion, intermediate with conse- quent decrease in ANTI stereoselectivity.

These are found to add to a given alkene in the rate order: HI > HBr HCl » HF, i.e. in order of their acid strengths. This suggests rate-limiting addition of proton to the alkene, followed by rapid nucleophilic attack by Hal® to complete the addition. In non-polar solvents the proton is no doubt provided by HHal, but in polar, and especially in hydroxylic solvents, more likely by its conjugate acid, e.g. by H3O® in H2O. A bridged intermediate exactly analogous to a bromonium ion cannot be formed as H has no electron pair available, but it may be that in some cases a n complex (21) is the intermediate.

Cationic polymerisation is often initiated by Lewis acid catalysts, e.g. BF3, plus a source of initial protons, the co-catalyst, e.g. traces of HjO etc.; polymerisation occurs readily at low temperatures and is usu- ally very rapid. Many more alkenes are polymerised by a radical induced pathway, however (p. 320). 7.4.4 Hydroxylation There are a number of reagents that, overall, add two OH groups to alkenes.

Direct addition of hydrogen normally involves heterogeneous catalysis by finely divided metals such as Ni, Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh. The atoms in the surface of a metal crystal will clearly differ from atoms in the body of the crystal in having ‘residual combining power’ directed away from the surface. It is significant in this context that both alkenes, e.g. ethene, and hydrogen, react exothermically, and reversibly, with the catalytic metals, e.g. nickel. With the alkene this presumably involves its it electrons as alkanes are not similarly adsorbed. No tt electrons are available in the hydrogen molecule either, and its adsorption must involve considerable weakening of its cr bond, though not necessarily complete fission to yield H- atoms. The actual spacings of the metal atoms in the surface will clearly be of importance in making one face of a metal crystal catalytically effective, and another not, depending on how closely the actual atom spacings approximate to the bond distances in alkene and hydrogen molecules. In practice only a relatively sma|l proportion of the total metal surface is found to be catalytically effective—the so-called ‘active points’. These adsorb alkene strongly, and then desorb immediately the resultant alkane, thus becomipg free for further alkene adsorption.

In preparative ozonolysis it is important to decompose the ozonide (57a) by a suitable reductive process, as otherwise H2O2 is produced (on decomposition of the ozonide with H2O, for example) which can further oxidise sensitive carbonyl compounds, e.g. aldehydes-^ carboxylic acids. The above pathway accounts satisfactorily for the main features of ozonolysis but requires modification in detail to account for the observed stereochemistry of the reaction.

A partial order of effectiveness is found to be, CHO > COR > COjR > CN > NO^ but SOR, SO 2R and F also act in the same way. Such substituents operate by reducing n electron density at the alkene carbon atoms, thereby facilitating the approach of a nucleophile, Y®, but more particularly by delocalising the -ve charge in the resultant carbanion intermediate, e.g. (89) and (90). This delocalisation is generally more effective when it involves mesomeric delocalisation (89), rather than only inductive electron-withdrawal (90) : The orientation of addition of an unsymmetrical adduct, HY or XY, to an unsymmetrically substituted alkene will be defined by the preferential formation of the more stabilised carbanion, as seen above (cf. preferential formation of the more stabilised carbocation in electrophilic addition, p. 184).

In fact, the last type of addition (93) normally yields the same product (94) as would be obtained from addition to C=C, owing to tautomerisation of the first formed enol (95), e.g. with the Grignard reagent PhMgBr followed by acidification : PhMgVr - ® R,C=CH-C=0 ^ R,C-CH=C-0®MgBr ' I II R Ph R (93) H i R2(j:-ch-<|:=o RjC-ch=c—oh Ph R Ph R (94) (95) Incidentally, \\,4-electrophilic addition (e.g. HBr) also yields the C=C adduct (96) for the same reason, and can be looked upon formally as acid-catalysed (97) addition of the nucleophile Br® ; H® © R,C=CH-C=0 R,C-CH=C-OH I I R R (97) H R,C-CH-C=0 *=r R2C-CH=C-0H ^ I 'l I Br R Br R (96) Less powerful nucleophiles such as ROH can also be made to add (1,4-) under acid catalysis.

This is so because the C=C adduct (98) obtained from 1,4-addition will tend to be thermodynamically more stable than the C=0 adduct (99), because the former contains a residual C=0 n bond, and this is stronger than the residual C=C n bond in the latter : V T R2C-CH-C=0 R2C=CH—c-oh II I Y R R (98) (99) Steric hindrance at one site can, however, be very potent at promoting", "doc_name": "Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "page": 207, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Reaction Mechanism\\Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

{"text": "206 Nucleophilic addition to C—O So far as steric effects are concerned, the least energy-demanding direction of approach by the nucleophile to the carbonyl carbon atom will be from above, or below, the substantially planar carbonyl compound. It is also likely to be from slightly to the rear of the carbon atom {cf. 12), because of potential coulombic repulsion between the approaching nucleophile and the high electron density at the carbonyl oxygen atom : ye ( 12 ) Increasing bulk in the R groups will slow the reaction as the sp^ hybridised carbon atom in the original carbonyl compound (R—C— R bond angle « 120°) is converted to an sp^ hybridised carbon atom in the adduct—and in the preceding T.S.^R—C— R bond angle wl09°). The R groups thus move closer together as the reaction proceeds, i.e. the T.S. becomes more crowded, its energy level therefore increases and the reaction rate drops, as R increases in size. The observed drop in reaction rate, H2C=0 > RHC=0 > R2C=0, is thus determined by both electronic and steric effects. Increase in size of the nucleophile, with a given carbonyl compound, may also lead to a drop in reaction rate for the same reason.

The prepara- tive intent of initial cyanohydrin formation is usually the further transformation of the CN group (e.g. by reduction, hydrolysis, etc.), and this can still be achieved—in high yield—on the MegSi deriva- tive. This further transformation must, however, be carried out under conditions (as shown above) such that any backward reaction to the initial carbonyl compound is prevented from taking place.

Often, either the initial addition step or the dehydration step can be made rate-limiting at will, depending on the pH of the solution. At neutral and alkaline pHs it is generally the dehydration, e.g. (72)— (71), that is slow and rate-limiting (cf. above), while at more acid pHs it is generally the initial addition of the nucleo- phile, e.g. (70) — (72), that is slow and rate-limiting. This clearly has significance in preparative terms, and formation of such derivatives of carbonyl compounds tends to exhibit pH optima—the value depend- ing on the nature of the particular carbonyl compound and of the ammonia derivative employed ; thus for the formation of an oxime from propanone, MejCO, the optimum pH is found to be %4-5. With aldehydes (and with unsymmetrical ketones, RCOR') there is, of course, the possibility of forming alternative syn and anti geometrical isomers: R H R ^c=n: H Y It is found in practice that the syn isomer usually predominates; with RCOR' this is the isomer in which Y is nearest to the smaller of the groups, R or R'.

Before considering carbanion reactions in general, however, two specific nucleophilic additions will first be mentioned. 8.4.1 Grignard, etc., reagents The actual composition/structure of Grignard reagents—commonly written as RMgX—is still a matter of some dispute. It appears to depend on the nature of R, and also on the solvent in which the reagent is, or has been, dissolved. Thus the nuclear magnetic resonance (n.m.r.) spectrum of MeMgBr in Et20 indicates that it is present largely as MgMej + MgBr 2 , while X-ray measurements on crystals of PhMgBr, isolated from Et02 solution, indicate that it has the composition PhMgBr- 2Et20, with the four ligands arranged tetrahedrally round the Mg atom.

Reliable details of the mechanism of Grignard addition to C=0 are surprisingly scanty for so well-known a reaction, but pathways closely analogous to the above (i.e. via 11a and 11b) can be invoked to explain two important further observations: (a) that Grignard reagents having H atoms on their ^-carbon atom (RCH^CHjMgX, 78) tend to reduce C=0—CHOH (79), being themselves converted to alkenes (80) in the process (transfer of H rather than RCHjCHj taking place): R H ~ R H “ \\ / \\ / C c \\ ''CHj H CHj 1 RiC^ ..

These latter reagents tend to give more of the normal addition product with sterically hindered ketones than do Grignard reagents, and also more 1,2- and less 1,4- addition with C=C—C=0 than do Grignard reagents (cf. p. 201). 8.4.2 Acetylide anions Acetylenes, RC=CH and HC=CH, are markedly acidic and may be converted by strong bases, e.g. ®NH 2 in liquid ammonia, into the corresponding anions (cf. p. 273), which are somewhat more nucleo- philic than ®CN. Though these species, e.g. RC=C , are palpably carbanions, they are considered separately as, unlike the group we shall consider below, they require no stabilisation by electron-with- drawing groups such as C=0, C^N, NO2 , etc. A useful group of carbon atoms may thus be added to C=0, and the reaction is especially useful synthetically in that the C=C linkage now present may be further modified in a variety of ways, e.g. reduced to the alkene (83) by H 2 with the Lindlar catalyst (cf. p. 191): RjC=^ ^C=CR' o® / liq.

The possibility of such an elimination may displace the equilibrium over to the right in a number of simple aldol additions, where it would otherwise lie far over to the left. It is important to remember, however, that the overall process aldol addition + dehydration is reversible, i.e. (88) 4=^ (96), and that a^-unsaturated carbonyl compounds are thus cleaved by base under suitable conditions. It is also pertinent that (96) is still an aldehyde and can undergo further carbanion addition, followed by dehydration, and so on. This is how low molecular weight polymers are produced on heating simple aliphatic aldehydes with aqueous NaOH : to stop at the aldol, the best catalysts are basic ion-exchange resins. Crossed aldol condensations, where both aldehydes (or other suitable carbonyl compounds) have a-H atoms, are not normally of any preparative value as a mixture of four different products can result. Crossed aldol reactions can be of synthetic utility, where one aldehyde has no ot-H, however, and can thus act only as a carbanion acceptor. An example is the Claisen-Schmidt condensation of aromatic aldehydes (98) with simple aliphatic aldehydes or (usually methyl) ketones in the presence of 10% aqueous KOH (dehydration always takes place subsequent to the initial carbanion addition under these conditions): ArCH=CHCHO ®CH,CHO (98) ArCHO ArCH=CHCOMe As would be expected, electron-donating groups in Ar slow the reaction, e.g. p-MeOCeH4CHO reacts at only about one-seventh the rate of CeHsCHO. Self-condensation of the aliphatic aldehyde can, of course, be an important competing reaction under these conditions, but Cannizzaro reaction of ArCHO (cf. p. 216) is so much slower a reaction as not to be a significant competitor.

{"text": "228 Nucleophilic addition to C=0 The carbanion (103) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde in the usual way to yield the alkoxide anion (106a). Internal transfer of the acetyl group in this anion is believed to take place: from the carboxyl oxygen atom (in 106a) to the alkoxy oxygen atom (in 106b), via the cyclic intermediate (107); thereby forming a more stable species. Removal of an a-H from this anion by MeCOj® results in loss of the good leaving group MeC02® from the adjacent ^-position to yield the anion (105a) of the -unsaturated acid. Work up of the reaction mixture with dilute acid leads to the product (105). Some support for this mechanism is provided by the observation that on reaction with anhydrides of the form (R2CHC0 )20—where there would be no a -H to remove in the intermediate corresponding to (106b)—it is possible to isolate the analogue of (106b) as the actual end-product of the reaction. 8.4.7 Knoevenagel and Stobbe reactions This addition involves carbanions from a wide variety of CHjXY types but particularly where X and/or Y are COjR groups, e.g. CH2(C02Et)2; organic bases are often used as catalysts.

The reason for considering it here rather than under carboxylic derivatives (p. 237) is that it can, in its initiation, be regarded as something of an analogue, for esters, of the aldol condensation on aldehydes {cf. p. 224), e.g. with ethyl ethanoate (acetate, 112): H I (112) CHiCOjEt O U)ti«OE.

This is finally converted by base (®OEt) into its stabilised (delocalised) carbanion, (115).

Further EtOH is generated in step (1), which yields further Na®®OEt with sodium, and the concentration of ®OEt is thereby maintained.

It involves the addition of a phosphonium ylid, e.g. (136), also known as a phosphorane, to the carbonyl group of an aldehyde or ketone; the ylid is indeed a carbanion having an adjacent hetero atom. Such species are generated by the reaction of an alkyl halide, RR'CHX (137), on a trialkyl- or triaryl-phosphine (138)—^very often PhgP—to yield a phosphonium salt (139), followed by abstraction of a proton from it by a very strong base, e.g. PhLi: PhjP + RR'CHX PhjP-CHRR' PhjP-CRR' (138) (137) X®(139) I Ph3P=CRR' (136) Addition of the Wittig reagent (136) to C=0, e.g. (140), is believed to follow the pathway : (140) R'iC^ ^ R'jC-O^ ^ ° RR'C— PPha RR'C-PPhj RR'C-^Phj RR'C PPhj e e (136) (141) (142) All Wittig reactions do not, however, follow the same detailed pathway: step (1) may, or may not, be an equilibrium, and the rate-limiting step may also differ.

The presence of C=C or C=C, even when conjugated with the C=0 group, does not interfere. A COjR group, though it will react with the ylid (136) does so very much more slowly than with C=0, and thus does not interfere either.

The relative reactivity of the series (156, with differing X) towards a particular nucleophile Y® (e.g. ®OH) depends on: (a) the relative electron-donating or -withdrawing power of X towards the earbonyl carbon atom, and (b) the relative ability of X as a leaving group. The reactivity series is not necessarily exactly the same for every Y®, but in general it follows the order: O O O O O II II II II II RC-CI > RC-OCOR > RC-OR' > RC-NHj > RC-NR'j Thus acid chlorides and anhydrides react readily with ROH and NHj to yield esters and amides, respectively, while esters react with NH 3 or amines to give amides, but the simple reversal of any of these reac- tions on an amide, though not impossible, is usually pretty difficult. The relative reactivity will also depend on both the electronic and, more particularly, the steric effect of R.

The question then arises whether, with the better potential leaving group Cl®, the reactions of acid chlorides could proceed either via a single step ‘8^,2 type’ pathway (c/. p. 78) involving a T.S., in which attack by Y® and loss of Q® are essentially synchronous; or via an ‘8^,1 type’ pathway (cf. p. 79) in which the slow step is RCOCl RCO®Cl®, followed by fast attack by Y® on the acyl cation, RCO®. In fact, most reactions of acid chlorides probably proceed via the now familiar ‘tetrahedral inter- mediate’ pathway, though there may be some exceptions. Acid anhydrides, (RC0)20, will also often react with weaker nucleophiles, though more slowly than acid chlorides; neither ‘8^1 nor 8;s,2 types’ of reaction pathway normally occurs.

Some evidence that the two processes do have a common intermediate is provided by the fact that the El/S,yl ratio is reasonably constant for a given alkyl group irrespective of the leaving group, Y®. The two processes do, however, proceed from (8) to products—(7) and (9), respectively—ria different T.S.s, and the factors that influence elimination v. substitution are discussed subsequently (p. 260). The factors that promote unimolecular, as opposed to bimolecular (E2), elimination are very much the same as those that promote S^l with respect to 8,^2, namely; (a) an alkyl group in the substrate that can give rise to a relatively stable carbocation, and (b) a good ionising, ion-solvating medium. Thus (a) is reflected in the fact that with halides, increasing El elimination occurs along the series, primary < secondary < tertiary reflecting the relative stability of the resultant carbocations; primary halides hardly ever undergo El elimination. Branching at the P- carbon atom also favours El elimination; thus MeCH2CMe2Cl is found to yield only 34% of alkene, while Me2CHCMe2Cl yields 62%. This is probably related to the fact that Me2CHCMe2Cl can lead to a more heavily substituted, and hence thermodynamically more stable (cf. p. 26), alkene than the first. This is, with El reactions, also the major controlling factor (Saytzeff elimination, p. 256) in orientation of elimination, where more than one alkene can be derived by loss of different ^ -protons from a carbocationic intermediate (8): H© CH, ©H CH, Me MeCHj-C <^.MeCH-C® ^ MeCH=C ^ \\ -H* \\ -H* \\ Me Me Me ( 10) (8 ) (7 ) Thus in the above case the elimination product is found to contain 82 % of (7).

One of the factors that affects the rate of E2 reactions is, hardly surprisingly, the strength of the base employed ; thus we find : ®NHj > ®OR > ®OH Some studies have been made with bases of the type ArO®, as this allows study of the effects of variation in basic strength (by introduction of p-substituents in C^HsO®) without concomitant change in the steric requirements of the base. With a given base, transfer from a hydroxylic solvent, e.g. HjO or EtOH, to a bipolar aprotic one, e.g. HCONMej (DMF) or MejS®—O® (DMSO), can have a very pro- nounced effect as the strength ofthe base, e.g. ®OH, ®OR, is enormously increased thereby. This arises because the base has, in the latter solvents, no envelope of hydrogen-bonded solvent molecules that have to be stripped away before it can act as a base (c/ effect on nucleophilicity in Syv2, p. 81). Such change of solvent may result in a shift of mechanistic pathway from El to E2 for some substrate/base pairs. To explain the effect change of Y may have on the rate of reaction of R—Y (in which R remains the same) we need to consider: (a) any effect Y may have on C—H bond-breaking (E2 is a concerted reaction), (b) the strength of the C—Y bond, and (c) the stability of Y®, as reflected in the pK„ of H—Y. ft thus comes as no surprise to find that forecasting the relative ability of Y as a leaving poup is far from easy! If the atom in Y that is directly bonded to C in R—Y (and to H in H—Y) remains the same, e.g. oxygen, then the rate of reaction of R—Y may correlate not too badly with the inverse of the p/C„ of H—Y : the stronger the oxy-acid, the better is", "doc_name": "Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "page": 258, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Reaction Mechanism\\Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

Where the atom through which Y is bonded to C in R— does not stay the same, however, this inverse correlation with pKa often breaks down.

Change of solvent thus can, and does, change the sequence of relative leaving group ability in a series of different Y®s.

{"text": "254 Elimination reactions Having established the desirability of elimination taking place from a planar conformation, there remains the question of whether either (24a) or (24b) is preferred over the other. Three possible grounds can be stated for favouring elimination from the anti-periplanar conformation (24a): (a) elimination would then be taking place from the lower energy ‘staggered’ conformation (24a), rather than from the higher energy ‘eclipsed’ conformation (24h; cf. p. 7), and this energy differential is likely to be reflected in the corresponding transition states; (b) the attacking base, B:, and the departing leaving group, Y®, would be as far apart from each other as possible in the T.S.; and (c) the electron pair developing from the initial C—H bond would be attacking the a -carbon atom from the side opposite to that from which the electron pair of the initial C—Y bond will be departing (cf. the favoured ‘backside’ attack in the Sfj2 pathway, p. 78). It seems likely that (a) will be the most significant of these features, however. We would thus forecast a preference for ANTI (‘opposite side’) elimination of H and Y (from 24a), rather than SYN (‘same side’) elimination (from 24b). Where, as with (24) above, both and C* are chiral, elimination from the two conformations will lead to different products—the trans- alkene (25) from (24a) and the cis-alkene (26) from (24b). Thus knowing the configuration of the original diastereoisomer (e.g. 24), and establish- ing the configuration of the geometrical isomeride(s) that is formed, enables us to establish the degree of stereoselectivity of the elimination process. In most simple acyclic cases, ANTI elimination is found to be very much preferred, e.g. in about the simplest system, (26) and (27), that permits of stereochemical distinction ; 0 For Y = Br, Ts or NMcs, elimination was essentially 100% stereo- selectively ANTI—only (28) was obtained from (26), and only (29) was obtained from (27).

The marked ANTI stereoselectivity observed with cyclohexyl systems (see above) reflects the ability to achieve, and the very marked preference to eliminate from, the so-called trans-diaxial conformation (34): Thus of the geometrical isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane, CgHgCle, one is found to undergo elimination of HCl at a rate slower, by a factor of 7-24 x 10^, than any of the others : it is found to be the one (35) that cannot assume the above trans-diaxial conformation.", "doc_name": "Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "page": 261, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Reaction Mechanism\\Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

Both generalisations are valid as the figures quoted above indicate. It is thus clear that the composition of the alkene mixture obtained on elimination is influenced by Y, the nature of the leaving group, and an explanation is required about how this influence may be exerted. Saytzev elimination, which appears to occur when Y is neutral (e.g. with Y = OTs, etc., as well as Br), leads to the more stable (i.e. more heavily substituted, cf. p. 26) alkene. It seems reasonable to suppose, therefore, that reaction here proceeds via a T.S. in which a not inconsiderable degree of ‘alkene character’ has already been developed; the alkyl substituents thereby being able to begin exert- ing their stabilising (energy lowering) effect quite early in the single step of the E2 pathway, e.g. (38a): I- 8 - -1 + EtO- • • H MeCH—CHCH3 L®- _ (38a) The preference for Saytzev elimination in the El pathway has already been referred to (p. 249).

E2 eliminations can thus involve transition states along a whole spectrum of ‘character , whose nature is determined in considerable part by Y. It is interesting in this respect that when Y is F, despite this not being -t-vely charged, there is a marked tendency towards the Hofmann product: thus EtCH2CH(F)CH3 leads to no less than 85% of EtCH2CH=CH2 . This ‘unexpected’ result stems from the ex- tremely powerful electron-withdrawing effect of F (cf. ®NMe3); and also that F® is an extremely poor leaving group, thereby delaying C—F bond-breaking in the T.S. ‘spectrum’. Support for the impor- tance of proton acidity, and the development of ‘carbanion charac- ter’ in the T.S., for Hofmann elimination is provided by the observa- tion that increase in the strength of the base attacking RY (whether Y is -t-vely charged or not) also leads to increasing formation of the Hofmann product.

Except where crowding becomes extreme, however, it seems likely that the electronic effects are commonly in control. In cyclic systems, the usual simple requirements of Saytzev or Hofmann rules may be overridden by other special requirements of the system, e.g. the preference for elimination from the trans-diaxial conformation in cyclohexane derivatives (c/. p. 255).

{"text": "260 Elimination reactions This is presumably the case because the developing p orbitals in an E2 reaction, far from being coplanar (c/ p. 253), would be virtually at right angles to each other (49), and so could not overlap significantly to allow development of a double bond. The relatively small ring system is rigid enough to make the distortion required for effective p orbital overlap energetically unattainable; there seems no reason why an E 1 or E IcB pathway would be any more successful : the bicyclo- heptene (48) has, indeed, never been prepared. With bigger rings, e.g. the bicyclononene (50), or a more flexible system (51), sufficient distortion is now possible to allow the introduction of a double bond by an elimination reaction: (50) ( 51 ) 9.5 ELIMINATION v. SUBSTITUTION E 1 elimination reactions are normally accompanied by 1 substitution, as both have a common—carbocationic—intermediate; though this is converted into either elimination or substitution products via different T.S.s in a fast, non rate-fimiting step. Similarly, E2 elimination is often accompanied by substitution, though in this case the parallel, concerted processes involve entirely separate pathways throughout. Thus considering elimination v. substitution there are really three main issues: (a) factors influencing El/S^l product ratios, (b) factors influencing E2/S^2 product ratios, and (c) factors influencing change of pathway, i.e. E1/Sn1 E2/Sn2 (or vice versa), as such a shift often changes the proportion of elimination to substitution. The last of these, (c), may well be the most potent. Thus El/S^l solvolysis of MejCBr, and of EtMe^CBr, in EtOH (at 25°) was found to yield 19% and 36%, respectively, of alkene; while introduction of 2M EtO®—which shifts the mechanism in part at least to E2/S;v2 resulted in the alkene yields rising to 93% and 99%, respectively. It is indeed found generally, for a given substrate, that the E2/S^2 ratio is substantially higher than the El/S^l ratio. A point that is worth bearing in mind when contemplating preparative, synthetic operations is the use of a less polar solvent (the El/S^l process is favoured by polar, ion-solvating media)—the classical alcoholic, rather than aqueous, potash for elimination of HBr from alkyl bromides. A shift in mechanism may also be induced by increasing the concentration of the base employed, e.g. ®OH; hence the classical use of concentrated, rather than dilute, potash for elimina- tion.", "doc_name": "Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "page": 266, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Reaction Mechanism\\Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}
{"text": "9.5 Elimination v. Substitution 261 In either (a) or (b), the carbon structure of the substrate is of considerable importance, the proportion of elimination rising on going; primary < secondary < tertiary. In electronic terms this stems from increasing relative stabilisation of the T.S. for elimination as the number of alkyl groups on the carbon atoms of the developing double bond increases (cf.p. 256). Thus with EtO® in EtOH on alkyl bromides, we find: primary—>ca. 10% alkene, secondary— ca. 60%, and tertiary— >90%. This stems not only from an increasing rate of elimination, but also from a ^creasing rate of substitution. Similarly, substituents such as C—C and Ar that can stabilise the developing double bond through conjugation (cf. p. 253) also strongly favour elimination; under comparable conditions, CH3CH2Br yielded a; 1 % alkene, while PhCH2CH2Br yielded w 99%. In El/S^l increasing branching in R—Y leads to an increase in the proportion of elimination. This arises from increasing stabdity of the progressively more highly substituted alkene product and, more importantly, of the T.S. leading to it from the carbocation inter- mediate. A steric factor may also operate to favour elimination in that the sp^ hybridised carbon atom in the carbocation (52) remains sp^ hybridised (=120° bond angles) on elimination (53), but be- comes sp^ hybridised (=109° bond angles) on substitution (54): RCH IIc \\ R R ( 53 ) RCHj C® \\ R R (52 ) RCHj (54) Crowding strain is thus re-introduced in the T.S. for substitution, but much less so, if at all, in the T.S. for elimination, and the differential between them will become greater—increasingly favouring elimination —as the size and degree of branching in the R groups increases; but only becoming significant when larger/more branched than \\le3C Y. A related, but slightly different, point is that the peripheral H will be much more accessible than the relatively hindered car- bocationic carbon; we should thus expect the proportion of elimina- tion to rise as the size of the attacking base/nucleophile increases: as is indeed observed, i.e. Me3CO® is usually better than EtO for carrying out elimination reactions with. This discussion has tended to centre on the E1 /Sn 1 case, but essentially analogous steric efferts are involved in the differential stabilisation of the T.S. for E2 with respect to the T.S. for S^2. The El/S^,! ratio is, of course, substantially independent of the leaving group Y, but this is not the case with E2/S;^2, where breaking of the C—Y bond is involved in each alternative T.S.

{"text": "262 Elimination reactions observed : Tosylatc < Br < SMe^ < NMcj The attacking base/nucleophile is obviously of importance also; we require, ideally, a species that is a strong base but a poor nuc- leophile. Preparatively, tertiary amines, e.g. EtaN, pyridine, are often used to promote elimination. Though these are not particu- larly strong bases, they are poor nucleophiles because of steric effects, e.g. branching in EtgN, impeding nucleophilic attack on carbon, but not basic attack on a peripheral hydrogen. The use of a base of relatively high b.p. is also advantageous (see below). Finally, elimination—whether El or E2—is favoured with respect to substitution by rise in temperature. This is probably due to elimina- tion leading to an increase in the number of particles, whereas substitu- tion does not. Elimination thus has a more -t-ve entropy term (cf. p. 241), and because this (AS+) is multiplied by T in the relation for the free energy of activation, AG+ (AG+ = AH+ -TAS+, cf. p. 38), it will increasingly outweigh a less favourable AH+ term as the temp- erature rises. 9.6 EFFECT OF ACTIVATING GROUPS We have to date considered the effect of alkyl substituents in promoting elimination reactions in suitable substrates, and also, in passing, that of Ar and C=C. Elimination is, in general, promoted by most electron- withdrawing substituents, e.g. CF3 , NO2 , ArSOj, CN, C=0, COzEt, etc. Their effect can be exerted : (a) through making the /S-H atoms more acidic (55), and hence more easily removable by a base, (b) through stabilisation of a developing carbanion by electron-withdrawal (56), or in some cases, (c) through stabilisation of the developing double bond by conjugation with it (57) ; „ bh b-h ; ; :N^H-CH2 o-c—ch—ch, .y e 1 I : 'Q Y OEt Y*\" (56) (57) BPi H t F.C-f+CH-CH, I Y (55) The more powerfully electron-withdrawing the substituent the greater the chance that the T.S. in an E2 elimination will be ‘carbanion-like’ (cf. p. 257), or even that the reaction pathway may be shifted to the ElcB mode (cf. p. 249), e.g. possibly with NO 2 or ArSOj, especially if the leaving group, Y, is a poor one.

Both reactions require higher temperatures than for the Cope reaction, carboxylic esters particularly so. One of the major advantages of this group of elimination reactions, as a preparative method for alkenes, is that the conditions are relatively mild, in particular any acidity/basicity is low. This means that it is possible to synthesise alkenes that are labile, i.e. which isomerise during the course of alternative methods of synthesis through bond migration (into conjugation with others), or molecular rearrangement. Thus pyrolysis of the xanthate (88) of the alcohol (89) results in the formation of the unrearranged terminal alkene (90), whereas the more usual acid-catalysed dehydration of (89) results in rearrangement in the carbocationic intermediate (91, cf. p.

{"text": "10.2 Carbanion stabilisation 273 10.2 CARBANION STABILISATION There are a number of structural features in R—H that promote the removal of H by bases through making it more acidic, and also features that serve to stabilise the resultant carbanion, R® ; in some cases both effects are promoted by the same feature. The main features that serve to stabilise carbanions are {cf. factors that serve to stabilise carboca- tions, p. 104): (a) increase in s character at the carbanion carbon, (b) electron-withdrawing inductive effects, (c) conjugation of the carbanion lone pair with a polarised multiple bond, and (d) aromat- isation. The operation of (a) is seen in the increasing acidity of the hydrogen atoms in the sequence: CHj—CHj < CH 2=CH 2 < HC=CH; the increase in acidity being particularly marked (see table above) on going from alkene to alkyne. This reflects the increasing s character of the hybrid orbital involved in the <r bond to H, i.e. sp^ < sp^ < sp\\ The s orbitals are closer to the nucleus than the corresponding p orbitals, and they are at a lower energy level ; this difference is carried through into the hybrid orbitals resulting from their deployment. The electron pair in an sp* orbital is thus held closer to, and more tightly by, the carbon atom than an electron pair in an sp^ or sp^ orbital (effectively, the apparent electronegativity of the carbon atom increases). This serves not only to make the H atom more easily lost without its electron pair, i.e. more acidic, but also to stabilise the resultant carbanion. The operation of (b) is seen in HCF3 (pJC„ = 28) and HC(Cp3)3 (pJC„ = 11 ), where the change from CH4 (pJC^ — 43) is brought about by the powerful electron-withdrawing inductive effect of the fluorine atoms making the H atom more acidic, and also stabilising the resultant carbanions, ®Cp 3 and ®C(CF 3)j by electron-withdrawal. The effect is naturally more marked in HC(Cp 3)3 where nine F atoms are involved —compared with only three in HCF3 despite the fact that they are not now operating directly on the carbanion carbon atom. We have already referred to the formation of ®CCl3 from HCCI3 (p. 267), where a similar electron-withdrawing inductive effect must operate. This is likely to be less effective with Cl than with the more electronegative F, but the deficiency may be overcome to some extent by the delocalisation of the carbanion electron pair into the vacant d orbitals of the second row element chlorine—this is, of course, not possible with the first row element fluorine. The destabilising influence of the electron-donating inductive effect of alkyl groups is seen in the observed carbanion stability sequence : CH3® > RCHj® > RjCH® > R3C® Hardly surprisingly, it is the exact reverse of the stability sequence for carbocations (p. 83).", "doc_name": "Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "page": 279, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Reaction Mechanism\\Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

The marked effect of introducing more than one such group on to a carbon atom may be seen from the table of pX^ values above (p. 272); thus CH(CN)3 and CH(N02)3 are as strong acids in water as HCl, HNO 3 etc. The question does arise however, about whether (lOah), (llab) and (12ab) ought to be described as carbanions : O and N are more electronegative than C and ( 10b), ( 11 b) and ( 12b) are likely to contribute markedly more to the hydrid anion structure than ( 10a), (1 la) and ( 12a), respectively.

Possible limiting mechanisms (c/ S^l/S^2) are those: (a) in which proton removal and proton acceptance (from the solvent) are separate operations, and a carbanion intermediate is involved, i.e. an intermolecular pathway; and (b) in which one and the same proton is transferred intramolecularly : (a) Bri H I B: R,C-CH=Y R'OH R,C-CH=Y t LRjC=CH-Y®J (25) carbanion intermediate H I I R,C=CH-Y (Intermolecular) (b) H 1 R2C-CH=Y B H R,C (26) T.S.

Indeed, though we have referred (and will, for convenience, continue to refer) to species such as (27) as carbanions, they are also—and perhaps more correctly—referred to as enolate anions. It is very common to find a pair of tautomers, such as (23a) and (23b), ‘underlain’ as it were by a single, stabilised carbanion/enolate anion such as (27). The other extreme case, i.e. wholly intramolecular proton transfer pathway (b), is seen in the EtjN: catalysed conversion of the optically active substrate (28) into (29) : Here it is found that the rate of loss of optical activity and the rate of isomerisation are identical, and if the reaction is carried out in the presence of D 2O (five moles per mole of substrate) no deuterium is incorporated into the product. The reaction is thus wholly intra- molecular under these conditions—no carbanion is involved—and is believed to proceed via a bridged T.S. such as (30). With a number of substrates features of both inter- and intra-molecular pathways are observed, the relative proportions being dependent not only on the substrate, but to a considerable extent on the base and solvent employed also. 10.4.2 Rate and structure In virtually all the examples we have been talking about, the slow, rate-limiting stage is the breaking—or forming—of a C—H bond;", "doc_name": "Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "page": 285, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Reaction Mechanism\\Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}
{"text": "280 Carbanions and their reactions this is one major respect in which carbon acids differ from those acids in which the incipient proton is attached to O, N, etc. The rate of such C—H bond-breaking can often be measured by determining the rate of hydrogen isotope exchange with suitable proton (deuteron) donors such as D2O, EtOD, etc. It is interesting, though hardly surprising, to find that this kinetic acidity scale (defined by /cj does not correlate directly with the thermodynamic acidity scale (defined by K) that we have considered to date, i.e. pX„ values ; ^1 R 3C-H + B: R 3C® + BH® (K = kjk^ ,) k , , for the former involves a AG* term and the latter a AG^ term, and there is no necessary relation between the two.

This probably reflects a greater degree of delocalisation of charge in the carbanion derived from CH3NO2 than in that from CH3C0CH2C02Et. In such cases both proton abstraction and donation tend to be slow, compared with those carbon acids in which the charge is more con- centrated on carbon in their carbanions. This is borne out by the effect ofC=N substituents on carbanions, where less charge delocalisa- tion would be expected than with a C=0 substituent ; thus CH2(CN)2 is found to have very much the same fcj value as CH2(COMe)2, despite the fact that its pX„ value is larger (i.e. acidity lower) by 3-2 units.

Rate = /lc[MeCOMe][®OH] i.e. was independent of [Br^]. Subsequently it was shown that, under analogous conditions, iodination took place at the same rate as bromination ; as was to be expected from the above rate law. We have already seen (p. 288) that base-induced deuterium exchange (in D2 O), and racemisation, of the optically active ketone (90) occur at the same rate, and are subject to a kinetic isotope effect (/c„ > k^) when the a-H atom is replaced by D, i.e. C—H bond-breaking is involved in the slow, rate-limiting step. All these observations make the involve- ment of a common carbanion intermediate, e.g. (91), virtually inescap- able: o o ®OH MeEtC—CPh MeEtC—CPh I slow H ( + ) (90 ) (91 ) MeEtC-CPh I Hal (±) (92) O II MeEtC—CPh ID (±) (93 ) This intermediate is then attacked in a fast, non rate-limiting step by any one of the series of electrophiles d2 > Br2 , l2 » H2O, D2O, etc.—to yield end-products such as (92), (93), etc.; all of which will necessarily be produced at the same rate. This process has a formal resemblance to slow, rate-limiting formation of a carbocationic intermediate, followed by rapid nucleophilic attack, in the S^l pathway; it is therefore referred to as an SeI process. With ketones such as (94), that have alternative groups of a-H atoms to attack, two questions arise: (a) which group, the CH 2 or the CH3, is attacked preferentially, and (b) when one H has been substituted by halogen, will a second halogen become attached to the same or to the other a-carbon atom. So far as (0) is concerned, it is found that bromination of, for example, MeCH 2COCH3 , yields 1- and 3-bromobutanones in virtually equal amount (both these bromoketones then undergo very rapid further reaction, cf. p. 296).

This energetic ad- vantage is, however, often reversed in polar solvents, because of the energy then developed—in heterolytic fission—from solvation of the developing ions.

Radical reactions also occur in solution, particularly if carried out in non-polar solvents, and if catalysed by light or the simultaneous decomposition of substances known to produce radicals themselves, e.g. organic peroxides. Radicals, once formed in solution, are generally found to be less selective in their attack on other species, or on alternative positions within the same species, than are carbo- cations or carbanions. Another characteristic of many radical reactions is that, once initiated, they often proceed with great rapidity owing to the establish- ment of fast chain reactions of low energy requirement, e.g. in the halogenation of alkanes (3, cf. p. 323): Br-Br R-H + Br -» R- + H-Br (3) jB,, •Br + R-Br In this case, the radical obtained photochemically, a bromine atom Br-, generates another, R-, on reaction with the neutral substrate, R—H (3). This radical reacts in turn with a further neutral molecule, Br 2 , generating Br- once again: the cycle thus proceeds without the need for further photochemical generation of Br-, i.e. it is self-per- petuating. It is also characteristic of such radical reactions that they can be inhibited by the introduction of substances that themselves react particularly readily with radicals (inhibitors, or radical ‘scavengers’), e.g. phenols, quinones, diphenylamine, iodine, etc. These and similar substances can also be used to bring a radical reaction, already in progress, to a stop (terminators). The first radicals to be studied were, hardly surprisingly, those that were somewhat less reactive, and thus capable of rather longer inde- pendent existence. The first such radical to be detected unequivocally was PhjC- (4), obtained in 1900 on reacting PhjCCl with finely divided silver (cf. p. 43).

The radicals were generated by the thermal decomposition of organometallic compounds, such as PbMc4, PbMc4 Pb + 4Me- and conveyed along a glass tube in a stream of an inert carrier gas, e.g. nitrogen. It was found that thin lead mirrors deposited at various distances along the inner wall of the tube were attacked by the stream of radicals. By measurements of how far along the tube mirrors continued to be attacked, coupled with a known rate of flow of carrier gas, it was possible to make accurate estimates of the half-life of alkyl radicals; for Me this was found to be 8 x 10“^ sec.

This produces a very high immediate concentra- tion of radicals, which may be detected—and whose fate may be followed—by spectroscopy through one or more subsequent pulses of lower intensity radiation of suitable wavelength. This is, of course, primarily a technique for the study of radicals rather than for their use in preparative procedures.

Such bonds very often involve elements other than carbon, and the major sources of radicals in solution are the thermolysis of suitable peroxides (0-^0) and azo compounds (C-^N).

Radical formation through carbon-carbon bond-fission is seen in the radical-induced ‘cracking’ at w6(X)° of long-chain alkanes. The radicals introduced initially into the system probably act by abstracting a hydrogen atom from a CHj group of the chain ; the resultant long chain, non-terminal radical (25) then undergoes fission P- to the radical carbon atom to yield a lower molecular weight alkene (26) plus a further radical (27) to maintain a chain reaction : Ra- H Ra-H RCH-CHjR' -» RCH-CHjR' - RCH=CH2 + -R' (25 ) (26 ) (27 ) Termination of the reaction by radical/radical interaction is unlikely to occur to any significant extent, until the concentration of long- chain alkane has dropped to a very low level.", "doc_name": "Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "page": 311, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Reaction Mechanism\\Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

{"text": "308 Radicals and their reactions 11.3 RADICAL DETECTION We have already seen how the high chemical reactivity of short-lived radicals can be enlisted to aid in their detection through their ability to etch metal mirrors (p. 301). The fact that the transition of an unpaired electron between the energy levels of a radical involves less energy than the transition of the paired electrons in the stable parent molecule means that the radical tends to absorb at longer wavelength. A number of radicals are thus coloured—where their precursors are not—and may readily be detected in this way, e.g. (1 1, p. 302) and (15, p. 302). Radicals may also be detected by their rapid discharge of the colour of solutions containing species such as l,l-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl ( 11 ). Another useful, and quite sensitive, test is the initiation of poly- merisation (c/ p. 320). Polymerisation can be initiated, in suitable substrates, by cations and anions as well as by radicals, but the effect of these several species can be differentiated by using a 50/50 mixture of phenylethene (styrene), PhCH=CH 2 , and methyl 2-methyl- propenoate (methyl methacrylate), CH 2 =C(Me)C02Me, as substrate: cationic initiators are found to produce polystyrene only, anions polymethyl methacrylate only, while radicals produce a copolymer containing equal amounts of the two monomers. By far the most useful method for detecting radicals is, however, electron spin resonance (e.s.r.) spectroscopy, which utilises the permanent magnetic moment conferred on a radical by virtue of the spin of its unpaired electron (radicals are paramagnetic, species con- taining only electron pairs are diamagnetic). The electron spin can have one of two values (-t-i or - j, c/. p. 2) and, in the presence of an applied magnetic field, these correspond to different energy levels; transitions are possible between them resulting in a characteristic, and detectable, absorption spectrum. E.s.r. spectroscopy of unpaired electrons is thus the analogue of n.m.r. spectroscopy of nuclei that have a permanent magnetic moment, e.g. ^H, etc.; hardly surpris- ingly, they occur in different energy ranges (an unpaired electron has a much larger magnetic moment than a proton— ’H—and more energy is required to reverse its spin). In e.s.r. spectroscopy, interaction (‘splitting') occurs between the unpaired electron and neighbouring magnetic nuclei—especially ‘H leading to quite complex patterns of lines ; analysis of these can provide a great deal of detailed information about the structure and shape of a radical. Thus hydrogen abstraction from cycloheptatriene (38) by • OH is found to lead to a radical having a very simple e.s.r. spectrum ; eight equally spaced lines, indicating interaction of the unpaired electron with seven equivalent *H nuclei. The product radical thus cannot have the expected structure (39)—which would have a very much more complex e.s.r. spectrum—but must be the delocalised", "doc_name": "Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "page": 314, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Reaction Mechanism\\Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

Radicals to be studied may sometimes be generated (by irradiation) actually in the cavity of the spectrometer; failing that, they may be generated just outside, and a continuous flow technique then used to maintain a ‘standing’ concentration in the spectrometer cavity. A disadvantage of this method is that it requires relatively large volumes, and quantities of starting material. The longer the life of the radical the greater the chance of observing its spectrum; thus species such as PhsC- are easily observed, but species like Ph-, PhCH2 *, C2Hs*, etc., are a little more difficult. A technique that has been used to ‘prolong’ the life of short-lived species is to introduce a suitable diamagnetic substance, e.g. (41), which will react with the transient radical, and convert it into a longer-lived radical (42) that can be detected quite readily: Ra- + McjC—N=0 (41) Ra I McjC—N—O- (42) This is known as ‘spin trapping’. Another technique, that has been used to study very short-lived radicals, is to generate them photo- lytically, from precursors, in a solid inert matrix, e.g. frozen argon. Their life is thus artificially prolonged because they are shielded from collision either with each other, or with other species that could terminate their existence. Quite apart from such specific physical methods for the detection of radicals, it should be emphasised that more general indications that radical intermediates are involved in a particular reaction are provided by its high susceptibility to the addition of radical initiators (cf. p. 314) or inhibitors (cf. p. 300), and (compared with polar reactions) its relative insusceptibility to change of solvent. 11.4 RADICAL SHAPE AND STABILISATION As with carbocations (p. 104) and carbanions (p. 276), the question arises of whether simple radicals—of the type RsC*—accommodate", "doc_name": "Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "page": 315, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Reaction Mechanism\\Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

Analysis of the lines, resulting from interaction between the unpaired electron and the paramagnetic nucleus, provides information about the degree of s character of the orbital in which the unpaired electron is accommodated.

The relative stability of simple alkyl radicals is found to follow the sequence: RjC- > RjCH- > RCHj- > CHj- This reflects the relative ease with which the C—H bond in the alkane precursor will undergo homolytic fission, and more particularly, decreasing stabilisation, by hyperconjugation or other means, as the series is traversed.

The stability of a radical increases as the extent of potential delocalisation increases; thus PhjCH- is more stable than PhCHj*, and PhjC- (c/. p. 300) is a pretty stable radical. The shape of PhjC* (49) is a matter of some interest as it has a bearing on the extent to which delocalisation of the unpaired electron, with consequent stabilisation, can occur. The radical carbon atom is certainly sp^ hybridised in (49), i.e. the bonds joining it to the three benzene nuclei all lie in the same plane ; but maximum stabilisation will only occur if all three benzene nuclei can be simultaneously coplanar (49a), (49M for only in this conformation can the p orbital on the central carbon atom interact equally, and maximally, with the n orbital systems of the three nuclei.

Thus though delocalisation occurs in (49) as indicated by its e.s.r. spectrum—it is not maximal, and its extent is not enormously greater in PhjC* than in PhjCH*, or even in PhCH 2 *. The major reason for the greater ‘stability’ of PhsC-, as reflected in its greater reluctance to dimerise, must therefore be largely steric: the crowding involved when two, enormously bulky, PhgC- radicals seek to combine with each other. A crowding that is echoed in the fact that the dimer, when formed, is found to be not the expected hexaphenylethane, PhsC—CPhs (cf. p. 301), but (7) resulting from the preferential reaction of one bulky PhgC- radical on the much more readily accessible periphery (through electron", "doc_name": "Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "page": 317, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Reaction Mechanism\\Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

Delocalisation must then be even further decreased, but such radicals with bulky o-substituents are nevertheless found to be more stable, i.e. more reluctant to form their dimers than is PhjC- itself. This must, of course, be due to a steric effect—the o-substituents are very close to the radical carbon atom and are thus capable of preventing its access to other species, or other species access to it [cf. (15), p. 302]. It is significant, in the light of what has been said above, that their effectiveness at ‘masking’ the radical carbon atom will increase the more the benzene rings are angled out of the coplanar conformation, i.e. the greater the dihedral angle.

Such a grouping has, for our purpose, the disadvantage of fitting much less well into the general classification of reaction types that has been adopted throughout. We shall therefore discuss the reactions in which radicals are involved, either as reactants or intermediates, under the general heads of addition, displacement and rearrangement. It is important to emphasise that in any reaction of a radical with a neutral molecule a further radical will be formed (cf. p. 309), thus establishing a chain reaction that does not require further input of initiator radicals to sustain it. Such a chain reaction is normally terminated by the relatively rare reaction of two radicals with each other (radicals are present in only very low ambient concentration) resulting in dimerisation or disproportionation (cf. p. 305), with no new radical now being produced. II.5.I Addition Additions to C=C are almost certainly the most important group of reactions involving radicals. This is due largely to the importance of addition (vinyl) polymerisation (p. 320), and the consequent extent to which its mechanism has been investigated ; but addition of halogens and of halogen hydracids is also of significance. II.S.1.1 Halogens In addition to the polar mechanism already considered (p. 179), halogen addition to alkenes can proceed via radical intermediates.

That each quantum of energy absorbed does indeed lead to the initiation of two reaction chains is confirmed by the observation that : Rate oc .^Intensity of absorbed light Chlorine atoms are electrophilic (the element is electronegative, and Cl- will readily take up an electron to complete its octet) and thus add readily to the double bond of (52) to yield the radical (53). This, in turn, can abstract a chlorine atom from a second molecule (the process can equally well be regarded as a radical displacement reaction on Cl—Cl) to yield the end-product of addition (54), plus a further atom of chlorine to continue the reaction chain, i.e. a very fast, continuing chain reaction is set up by each chlorine atom initiator generated photochemically.

The addition of fluorine— not requiring photochemical or other activation—is too vigorous to be of much use, and side reactions are common. Chlorination is generally rapid, with long reaction chains, and not readily reversible except at temperatures >200°; as the temperature rises, however, there is an increasing tendency to hydrogen abstraction leading to overall substitution by chlorine—rather than addition—in suitable cases (cf. p. 325). Bromination occurs readily, but with somewhat shorter reaction chains, and is usually reversible, while iodination takes place with difficulty, if at all, and is very readily reversible. The effect of increasing alkyl substitution at the double bond carbon atoms is found to have relatively little effect on the rate of halogen addition, certainly a good deal less than for addition by the polar mechanism (p. 183).

This difference in orientation of HBr addition is due to the fact that in the first (polar) case it is initiated by H® and proceeds via the more stable (secondary) carbocation, while in the second (radical) case it is initiated by Br- and proceeds via the more stable (secondary) radical (65): RO- + H-Br - RO—H + Br- i MeCH=CH 2 + Br- - MeCH—CHjBr (65) (63) t Br- + MeCHj-CHjBr (64) The initiation is by Br*, as hydrogen abstraction by RO* from HBr (as above) is energetically much more favourable than the alternative of bromine abstraction to form ROBr + H* .

Thus a few radical additions of HCl are known, but the reactions are not very rapid, and the reaction chains are short at ordinary temperatures. Even with HBr addition the reaction chains tend to be rather short much shorter than those in halogen addition—and more than a trace of peroxide is thus needed to provide sufficient initiator radicals ; for preparative purposes up to 0-01 mol peroxide per mol of alkene. In practical terms, however, there may already be sufficient peroxide", "doc_name": "Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "page": 323, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Reaction Mechanism\\Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

Once initiated, reaction by this pathway is very much faster than any competing addition via the polar pathway, and the anti-Markownikov product, e.g. (64), will thus predominate. If the Markownikov product, e.g. MeCH(Br)CH 3 from propene, is required it is necessary either to purify the alkene rigorously before use, or to add inhibitors (good radical acceptors such as phenols, quinones, etc.) to mop up any radicals, or potential radicals, present; the latter is much the easier to do preparatively. Essentially complete control of orientation of HBr addition, in either direction, can thus be achieved, under preparative conditions, by incorporating either peroxides (radical initiators) or radical inhibitors in the reaction mixture. This is particularly useful as such control is not confined purely to alkenes themselves: CH^^CHCH^Br, for example, can be converted into 1,2- or 1,3-dibromopropane at will. In any consideration of stereoselectivity in radical addition to acylic substrates, interpretation of the results is complicated by the knowledge that alkenes may be converted, at least in part, into their geometrical isomerides by traces of bromine (or of HBr, i.e. by Br% cf. p. 315). This may, however, be minimised by working at low temperatures, and by using a high concentration of HBr. Thus addition of liquid HBr at —80° to cis 2-bromobut-2-ene (67) was found to proceed with high TRANS stereoselectivity, and to yield (68) almost exclusively : Essentially exclusive TRANS addition of HBr also occurred with the trans isomeride of (67), i.e. (70), under analogous conditions. To account for this very high TRANS stereoselectivity, it has been suggested that addition proceeds via a cyclic bromonium radical (71), analogous to the cyclic bromonium cations involved in the polar addition of bromine to alkenes (p. 180): The overall addition would then be completed through attack by HBr from the less hindered side (away from bridging Br) to yield the", "doc_name": "Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "page": 324, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Reaction Mechanism\\Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

However, addition of HBr to (67) at room temperature, and using a lower concentration of HBr, is found to result in a 78 % : 22 % mixture of the products arising from TRANS and CIS stereoselective addition, (68) and (72), respectively. Significantly, the same mixture of products, in the same proportion, is obtained under these conditions from the trans isomeride of (67), namely (70). This strongly suggests that, under these conditions, rotation about the central carbon-carbon bond is sufficiently rapid for conformational equilibrium to be established between the radical intermediates, (69) and (73), before they can abstract H from HBr to complete overall addition: There are reasons for believing that this common product mixture from each of the two alkenes—(67) and (70)—does not arise from equilibration of these starting materials before addition proper takes place. It could well be that the higher degree of TRANS stereoselectivity observed (p. 318) for addition at lower tempera- ture, and with higher concentration of HBr, results not from the intervention of a cyclic bromonium radical (71), but from slower rotation about the central carbon-carbon bond. Relatively rapid H transfer (by the higher concentration of HBr) could then take place to the less hindered side of (69) or (73), leading to preferential TRANS additional overall.

{"text": "11.5.1.4 Vinyl polymerisation 321 As the alkene monomers can absorb oxygen from the air, forming peroxides (c/. p. 329) whose ready decomposition can effect auto- initiation of polymerisation, it is usual to add a small quantity of inhibitor, e.g. quinone, to stabilise the monomer during storage. When subsequent polymerisation is carried out, sufficient radical initiator must therefore be added to ‘saturate’ the inhibitor before any poly- merisation can be initiated ; an induction period is thus often observed. The radical initiators are not, strictly speaking, catalysts—though often referred to as such—for each radical that initiates a polymer chain becomes irreversibly attached to it and, ifof suitable composition, may be detected in the molecules of product. The efficiency of some initiators may be so great that, after any induction period, every radical generated leads to a polymer chain. Termination of a growing chain can result from collision with either an initiator radical (c i) or with another growing chain (c ii), but of these the latter is much the more frequent, as the initiator radicals will have been largely used up in starting the chains. Termination has been shown above as dimerisation (c ii), but it can also involve dispropor- tionation (cf. p. 305) between growing chains (c iii). H-abstraction can ailso occur by attack of a growing chain on ‘dead’ (no longer growing) polymer, leading to a new growing point and, hence, to branching (76): Ra(CHjh,-H Ra(CHjh..,CH3 (CH^),.- I —* . (CH,=CH,). I Ra(CHj),CH(CHj),Ra Ra(CHj).CH(CHj),Ra Ra(CH2),CH(CHj),Ra (76 ) The extent to which branching occurs can, hardly surprisingly, have a profound effect on the physical and mechanical properties of the resultant polymer. Another major influence on the properties of the polymer is the average molecular weight, i.e. the average length of polymer molecules ; this may vary from only a few monomer units to many thousand. Apart from the average length of polymer molecules, the actual spread of lengths among the polymer molecules also has a considerable influence; thus the properties of two polymers of approximately the same average m.w. will differ greatly if one is made up of molecules all of much the same length, while the other includes both very long and very short polymer molecules in its make-up. The length of molecules in a polymer may be controlled in a number of ways. Thus increase in the concentration of initiator, relative to that of alkene, will lead to shorter chain lengths ; the number of growing chains is increased, and termination thus becomes more probable relative to continued propagation. Alternatively, actual terminators may be added or, more usually, chain transfer agents. These are compounds, usually of the form XH, that suffer H-abstraction by a growing polymer chain.", "doc_name": "Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "page": 327, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Reaction Mechanism\\Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

In the case of terminators, XH IS chosen so that X- is not reactive enough to initiate a new chain from monomer. Radical-induced polymerisation of simple alkenes, e.g. ethene and propene, requires vigorous conditions including very high pressure but many other alkene monomers carrying substituents polymerise readily. These include CH,=CHC1 polyvinyl chloride (p.v.c.) for making pipes, etc., CH2—CMeC02Me —» perspex, PhCH=CH2 — » poly^yrene, the expanded form for insulation, etc., and teflon, which has an extremely low coefficient of fric- tion high chemical inertness and high m.p. (lining of frying pans, etc.). The properties of a polymer may be varied even further— almost as required—by the copolymerisation of two different monomers so that both are incorporated, equally or in other propor- tions, in the polymer molecules; thus most of the synthetic rubbers are styrene/butadiene copolymers. Reference has already been analytical use of 50:50 copolymerisation of PhCH—CHj and CHz—CMeCOjMe to distinguish radical-induced polymerisation from that initiated by anions or cations (cf. p. 188) Radical-induced polymerisation has some drawbacks, however thus branching induced by H-abstraction from the growing chain has already been referred to (p. 321). Another difficulty arises with monomers of the form CH,=CHX(i.e. with all the common monomers except CHj—CH^ and CF^—CF^) over the orientation of the sub- stituent groups, X, with respect to the ‘backbone’ alkane chain of polymer molecules, whose conformation is ‘frozen’ in the final rigid solid. In radical polymerisation, the arrangement of the X groups is random, and such atactic polymers, e.g. atactic polypropene, are found to be non-crystalline, low density, low melting, and mechanically weak. It has been found, however, that use of a TiClj-AlEtj catalyst results not only in polymerisation occurring under very mild conditions, but with, for example, propene, the resultant polymer has all the Me groups oriented, regularly, in the same direction. This isotactic poly- propene is found to be crystalline, high density (closer packing of chains) high melting, and mechanically strong—all desirable qualities and branching has been largely avoided. This regular, coordination polymerisation is believed to result from groups of atoms in the surface of the heterogeneous catalyst acting as a template, so that each successive monomer molecule can be added to the growing polymer", "doc_name": "Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "page": 328, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Reaction Mechanism\\Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

When the monomers are conjugated dienes, e.g. buta-1,3-diene, CH2=CH—CH=CH2 , or 2-methylbuta- 1,3-diene (isoprene), CH2=C(Me)—CH=CH2 , the polymer chain obtained from normal (1,4-, cf. p. 195) addition polymerisation will still contain one carbon-carbon double bond per monomer unit. The resulting re- sidual reactivity allows of chemical cross-linking from one polymer chain to another, e.g. the formation of S—S ‘bridges’ between the polymer chains by reaction with sulphur in the vulcanisation of rubber. A relatively low degree of cross-linking is found to impart elastic properties to the polymer aggregate, while carrying it further yields a rigid structure through extensive cross-linking in three dimensions. A stereochemical point also arises, in that the relative orientation of the parts of the polymer molecule on each side of a double bond in the chain can be either cis or irons to each other, e.g. with polyisoprene: \\=c/ A/VWkAA A.V'BWVl Me' J cis N / .c=c Me' We might well expect this differing stereochemistry to have a marked effect on the properties of the polymer, and this is borne out by the two naturally occurring polyisoprenes, natural rubber and gutta percha.

S^2. In some cases a radical is obtained from the substrate by abstraction (usually of H), and this radical then effects displacement on, or addition to, a further species.

Radical halogenation (particularly chlorination) by reagents other than the halogens themselves is of considerable synthetic impor- tance because of its greater stereoselectivity.

The initial stage is commonly the formation of hydroperoxides, RH^ ROOH, so it is a net, overall displacement, though the actual pathway involves H- abstraction and O2 addition (see below). The first-formed hyd- roperoxides frequently undergo further reactions. Autoxidation is of importance in the hardening of paints, where unsaturated esters in the oils used form hydroperoxides, whose decomposition to RO* initiates polymerisation in further unsaturated molecules to form a protective, polymeric, surface film. But autoxidation is also respon- sible for deleterious changes, particularly in materials containing unsaturated linkages, e.g. rancidity in fats, and perishing of rubber. Indeed, the gradual decomposition of most organic compounds expiosed to air and sunlight is due to photosensitised autoxidation. Autoxidation may be initiated by trace metal ions {cf. below), as well as by light and the usual radical initiators.

Ethers are particularly prone to autoxidation, initial attack taking place at a C—H linkage a- to the oxygen atom to yield a stabilised radical; the first-formed hydroperoxide reacts further to yield dialkyl peroxides that are highly explosive on heating not to be forgotten on evaporating ethereal solutions to dryness! Accumulated peroxides, in ether that has been standing, may be safely decomposed before its use by washing with a solution of a reducing agent, e.g. FeS04 . Autoxidation may in some cases be of preparative use ; thus reference has already been made to the large-scale production of phenol + acetone by the acid-catalysed rearrangement of the hydroperoxide from 2-phenylpropane (cumene, p. 128). Another example involves the hydroperoxide (94) obtained by the air oxidation at 70° of tetrahydro- naphthalene (tetralin); the action of base then yields the ketone (a-tetralone, 95), and reductive fission of the 0—0 linkage the alcohol (a-tetralol, 96) : (96) (94) (95)", "doc_name": "Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "page": 335, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Reaction Mechanism\\Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

Overall substitution reactions have been investigated in which Ra- is Ar- (especially Ph-), PhCOa- (and some RCOj-), R- and HO-. Attack by HO-, hydroxylation, is of particular importance in biologi- cal systems: as the first step in the detoxification of ‘foreign’ aromatic molecules. There are also a few reactions known in which it is an atom or group other than H, e.g. halogen, MeO, that is displaced. It is, however, the displacement of H by Ar arylation— that has been studied in by far the greatest detail. Attack of, for example, Ph- on aromatic species such as benzene is found to lead to products other than the one arising from overall substitution (107, Ra = Ph). This is because the intermediate radical (106), as well as undergoing H-abstraction to (107), can also dimerise to (108) and/or disproportionate to (107) -|- (109); ( 109 ) For simplicity’s sake only the products of p-interaction in (106) have been shown above ; o-interaction can also lead to an o-dihydro isomer of (109), and to both o-/o- and o-/p-coupled isomers of (108).

Such phenolic coupling reactions, control- led by enzymes, are of the greatest importance in the biosynthesis of many natural products including alkaloids, lignins, pigments and antibiotics. 11.5.3 Rearrangement Rearrangements that involve radicals are found to be much less common than otherwise similar rearrangements that involve carbo- cations.

The transition states are cyclic, ones involving six p electrons (c/ aromaticity, /p. 17) being preferred though not essential, and the reactions are normally attended by a high degree of stereoselectivity {cf. p. 268). Many of the reactions are reversible, e.g. Diels-Alder reactions, though the equilibrium often lies well over to one side or the other. The term pericyclic has been coined to describe such concerted reactions that proceed via cyclic transition states. As pericyclic reactions are largely unaffected by polar reagents, solvent changes, radical initiators, etc., the only means of influencing them is thermally or photochemically. It is a significant feature of pericyclic reactions that these two influences often effect markedly different results, either in terms of whether a reaction can be induced to proceed readily (or at all), or in terms of the stereochemical course that it then follows. Thus the Diels-Alder reaction (cf. above), an example of a cycloaddition process, can normally be induced ther- mally but not photochemically, while the cycloaddition of two molecules of alkene, e.g. (4) to form a cyclobutane (5), Ph Ph Ph Ph (5) can be induced photochemically but not thermally.

The former reflects the degree of ordering—of participant molecules or groups—required by a Cyclic T.S.; while the latter reflects the extent to which energy derived from bond-formation in the T.S. can assist in necessary bond-breaking. It should, however, be stressed that observation of high -ve AS^, and low +ve AH’*^, values for a particular reaction cannot necessarily be taken as establishing that it proceeds via a concerted pathway. So far as AH’*' is concerned, it would seem reasonable to suppose that the favoured pathway for a particular reaction would be that one in which the greatest degree of residual bonding is maintained in the T.S. Maintenance of bonding implies maintenance of orbital overlap, and it is therefore necessary to establish the conditions that ensure the maintenance of such overlap.

{"text": "350 Symmetry controlled reactions electron-withdrawing substituents in the dienophile; the reaction does indeed proceed poorly, if at all, in the absence of the latter. The effect of such substituents is to lower the energy level of the | LUMO in the dienophile and to raise the energy level of the HOMO in the diene, thus enhancing the degree of possible interac- tion between them. The presence of substituents, and even of hetero atoms, in the system appears not to affect the symmetry of the orbitals involved, however. Substituents in the diene may also affect the cycloaddition sterically, through influencing the equilibrium proportion of the diene that is in the required cisoid conformation. Thus bulky 1-cis substituents (28) slow the reaction down, whereas bulky 2-substituents (29) speed it up, through this agency : Another stereochemical point of significance is that in some Diels- Alder reactions there is the possibility of two alternative modes of addition, the exo (30) and the endo (31), e.g. with cyclopentadiene (32), and maleic anhydride (33) as dienophile : (30) (33 ) (31 ) Despite the fact that the exo adduct is likely to be the more stable of the two thermodynamically, it is often (though not universally) found in Diels-Alder reactions that the endo adduct is the major, if not the sole, product. To explain this, it has been suggested that in endo addition stabilisation of the T.S. can occur (and the rate of reaction thereby speeds up) through secondary interaction of those lobes of the HOMO in, e.g. (32) and of the LUMO in (33) that are not themselves involved directly in bond-formation, provided these are of the same phase. Such interaction would not, of course, be possible in the T.S. for exo addition because the relevant sets of centres in (32) and (33) will now be too far apart from each other; the endo adduct is thus the kinetically controlled product.

The great advantage of the Diels-Alder reaction (as a carbon- carbon bond-forming process) is its generality ; the variety of different dienophiles that can be used preparatively is very wide indeed (possible variations in the diene are somewhat less wide), and conditions can usually be found to make the great majority of such cycloadditions go in satisfactory yield. Like other cycloadditions, Diels-Alder reactions are potentially reversible and in some cases the reverse process, the retro Diels-Alder reaction, can be made preparatively useful. Thus cyclopentad iene (32) will readily undergo an auto Diels-Alder reaction to form a tricyclic dimer; it is commonly stored in this, relatively stable, form and reconverted to (32) on heating, i.e. by distillation, as required. The thermal cracking of cyclohexene (the Diels-Alder adduct of butadiene and ethene—though not prepared that way!) has been used as a useful method for the laboratory preparation of butadiene. A few Diels-Alder reactions are known, particularly those involving hetero atoms and/or highly polar substituents, that proceed via a non-concerted, two-step pathway involving zwitterion inter- mediates. Reactions proceeding via a two-step pathway involving biradical intermediates have not, however, yet been observed.

A model related to the transition state can be constructed by the device of assuming that the C— H <7 bond that is migrating can be broken down into a hydrogen Is orbital and a carbon 2p orbital. For the case where x = 1 in (36), the T.S. can then be considered as being made up from a pentadienyl radical (38), with a hydrogen atom (one electron in a Is orbital) migrating between the terminal carbon atoms of its 5ne system (i.e. a 6e system overall is involved) : (38) By analogy with the categories of pericyclic reactions we have already considered, the feasibility of the migration will then be decided by the relative phase of the terminal lobes, i.e. the symmetry, of the HOMO of the pentadienyl radical (38).

The latter effect, because it involves the more readily polarisable ir electron system, is the greater of the two, and the overall result is therefore net electron -donation (o-p_Meo = -0-27); as is required by the observation that the p-MeO ester is hydrolysed markedly more slowly than the unsubstituted compound (cf. p. 154).

Looking at the list of p values (p. 364), we can select first a reaction with a sizeable -ve p value, say reaction 2—the benzoylation of m- and p-substituted anilines (9)—with p = -2-69, and look at this reaction rather more closely; The slow, rate-limiting step of this reaction is found to be initial attack by the electron pair of the nitrogen atom of the substituted aniline (9) on the carbonyl carbon atom of the acid chloride. This results in the development of +ve charge at the reaction centre—the N atom attached directly to the substituted benzene ring in the forming intermediate (10). The reaction is thus accelerated by electron-donating substituents, which help delocalise this forming -l-ve charge in the transition state leading to the intermediate (10), and correspondingly retarded by electron -withdrawing substituents; this behaviour is found to hold in general for reactions with -ve p values.

Thus p can be regarded as a measure of the susceptibility of a reaction to the electron-donating or- withdrawing effect exerted by a substituent X; relative, of course, to the susceptibility (towards such a substituent) of the standard reaction—the aqueous dissociation of m- and p-substituted benzoic acids at 25°—for which p = -l-l OO, by definition. The sign of p is of diagnostic value, as we have seen, in that a -ve value indicates the development of +ve charge (or, of course, the disappearance of —ve charge) at the reaction centre during formation of the T.S. in the rate-limiting step of the overall reaction; while, vice versa, a +ve value indicates the development of -ve charge (or the disappearance of -(-ve charge) at that centre. The magnitude of p can be regarded, therefore, as a measure of the change in charge density at the reaction centre during formation of the T.S., or on proceeding from one side of an equilibrium to the other. On this basis, it might well be expected that the p value, of otherwise similar reactions, would decrease as the reaction centre is moved further away from the substituents that are exerting a polar, electronic effect upon it.

This effect will be particularly marked in (19b), where the anion will be stabilised substantially by delocalisation of its -ve charge, and the ionisation equilibrium for P-NO2 phenol thereby displaced over towards the right in the anion’s favour; thus increasing this phenol’s strength as an acid. The value for tr p.NOj obtained from the standard reaction (18a 18b) clearly does not take into account the heightened effect of this \"through-conjugation’, which is why the point for P-NO2—and for p-CN—is off the line in Fig. 13.4.

It would be nice to think that these dual substituent constant values would now take care of all eventualities, and an analysis was therefore made of no less than eighty different reactions to see whether use of a-p_x or o-p.x, and cTp.x or <Tp_x, would lead to straight line plots in all cases. In fact, it was found that the values required for, say, P-NO2 did not cluster round either 0-78(cr) or l-27(cr“), but were spread more or less evenly through- out the range between these two, limiting values; and similarly for p-MeO. between —0-27(cr) and — 0-78(<r^). On reflection, this is seen to be hardly surprising. The extent of the change in electron density at the reaction centre—an atom attached directly to the benzene ring in such reactions—during the slow, rate-limiting step will obviously differ from one reaction to another. So too, therefore, will the degree of response (via through- conjugation) elicited from the same p-substituent towards differing reactions. Hence the apparent need for a range of different cTp.x values for a particular p-substituent, reflecting the differing degrees of through-conjugation elicited from it by different reactions. 13.3.7 Yakawa-Tsano equation There have been a number of attempts, by the introduction of a further parameter into the Hammett equation, to quantify this graded response—via through-conjugation—on the part of a p- substituent. Among the best known of these is the Yukawa-Tsuno equation, [7], which, in the form shown here, is log^ = P[o-X + - orj] [7]", "doc_name": "Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "page": 378, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Reaction Mechanism\\Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

Similarly, for a reaction in which no through-conjugation occurs r will be zero, and [7] will then, of course, simplify to the original, simple Hammett equation [6]: >og^=PCTx [6] Kh To evaluate r for other reactions, we can obtain p for the reaction by measuring kx values for m -substituted compounds only, and then measure kx for p-substituted compounds where the values of <^p-x and o-p.x , or o-p_x , are already known.

When a simple Hammett plot exhibits an upward deviation, i.e. is concave upwards as in Fig. 13.6, then this can usually be taken as evidence of a change in overall reaction pathway, as the nature of the substituent is varied. That a change in reaction pathway should lead to an upward deviation is reasonable enough: in Fig. 13.6, there is, at the point where departure from linearity occurs, nothing to prevent the initial 8^,2 pathway from continuing to operate (along the dotted extrapolation).

The question does then arise, given the observed shift in reaction pathway for the ethyl esters (34b), why does a similar shift not occur with the corresponding methyl esters (34a)? Such a shift would, of course, necessitate the formation of a methyl, CHf , rather than an ethyl, MeCH® (37b), cation in the slow, rate-limiting step.

In step (2), +ve charge is increasing at the reaction centre (the carbon atom carrying the two substituted Ar groups), while in step (3), +ve charge is decreasing at the reaction centre. How does this match up with the requirements of Fig. 13.8 (p. 381)? The right-hand side of the plot in Fig. 13.8 has a -ve p value (-2-51) indicating the development of substantial +ve charge at the reaction centre during the overall, rate-limiting step. This would, of course, be compatible with step (2) being rate-limiting, but not with step (3). For the left-hand side of the plot in Fig. 13.8, exactly the reverse is true; here a -l-ve p value (-I-2-67) indicates a substantial decrease of -l-ve charge at the reaction centre, which would be compatible with step (3) being rate-limiting, but not with step (2). It is significant that the substituents involved at the far left-hand side of the plot (38; X, Z= MeO) are powerfully electron-donating, and thus capable of stabilising the carbocation (41a<^41h), de- veloping in step (2), by delocalisation of its -l-ve charge.

It is thus step (3) that is slow, and hence rate-limiting overall, for compound (38; X, Z = MeO).

There must, therefore, come a point at which speeding-up step (3) catches up with the slowing-down step ©; any further decrease in electron- donation by the substituents must result in step @ becoming slower than step @, thereby making it now rate-limiting for the overall reaction. This shift in rate-limiting step from step @^step @ occurs, in Fig. 13.8, with the compound (38; X, Z = Me). Still further decrease in electron-donation by the substituents, beyond this point, will result in still further slowing-down of step ©—now the rate-limiting step—and hence slowing-down of the overall reaction, i.e. the slope on the right-hand side of the plot is now downwards from left to right (p is — ve). For a reaction in which such a shift of rate-limiting step is observed (as the electron- donatingZ-withdrawing ability of the substituent is changed) there will be one substituent, or narrow range of substituents, for which the balance between the rates of step © and step @ is such as to make the overall reaction rate a maximum. This happens in Fig. 13.8, as we have seen, with the compound (38; X, Z = Me). On each side of this maximum the, different, rate-limiting step will be slowing down progressively, and so there- fore will the overall reaction rate.

The reactions of o-substituted benzene derivatives, and indeed of aliphatic com- pounds, were excluded because of the operation of steric and other effects, which led to non-linear, or even to apparently random, plots. The success and utility of Hammett plots, and the realisation that they are often of most value diagnostically when they do indeed diverge from linearity, has emboldened a number of workers to seek, with suitable modifications, to extend their scope to a much wider range of compounds. The most general and successful of these extensions was proposed by Taft.", "doc_name": "Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "page": 389, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Reaction Mechanism\\Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

Using [10] in this way, straight line plots were obtained for a number of different reactions of aliphatic compounds. 13.5.2 Steric parameters, Es and 8 After all the emphasis we placed earlier (p. 361) on steric effects, obtaining a straight line plot may at first sight seem a rather surprising result; especially, given that the relation [10] takes into account only the polar effect exerted by R. However, obtaining a straight line plot, using [10], does not necessarily mean that no steric effects are operating in a reaction. It means only that there is no substantial change in the operation of such effects on going from starting materials to the transition state for the rate-limiting step of the overall reaction (or on going from starting materials to products for an equilibrium). It is not necessary to look very far to find aliphatic reactions that do not yield straight line plots with [10], however; and, as with previous deviations from linearity (p. 375), these departures are commonly much more informative about the details of reaction pathways than are neat straight lines. Where such departures from linear (polar effects only) plots are observed, suggesting the opera- tion of significant—and changing—steric effects, it is possible to incorporate a steric substituent parameter, Es, whose evaluation is based on an earlier observation. Thus we have already seen (p. 384) that the acid-catalysed hydrolysis of m- and p-substituted benzoate esters (42) is (with a p value of 0-03) essentially uninfluenced by any polar effect exerted by the substituent, X; and this substituent is sufficiently far removed from the reaction centre to be clearly incapable of exerting any steric effect on it either.

There is no reason to believe that acid-catalysed hydrolysis of aliphatic esters, RC02Et, will be any more susceptible to polar effects than was the corresponding hydrolysis of benzoate esters. If then different hydrolysis rates are observed with aliphatic esters as R is varied, these must reflect differing steric effects exerted by the different R groups. Such aliphatic esters are indeed found to undergo hydrolysis at markedly different rates, so it is possible, taking Me as the standard sub- stituent once again, to use equation [11] to evaluate Eg, the steric substituent parameter, for R. Eg values, obtained in this way for a number of different substituents, are listed below: R in RCOjEt Es R in RC02Et Es H + 1-24 Me(CH2)3 -0-39 Me 0 (by definition) Me2CHCH2 -1-13 Et -0-07 MejC -1-54 ClCHj -0-24 Me3CCH2 -1-74 ICHj -0-37 PhjCH -1-76 PhCHj -0-38 Et3C -3-81 From the form of equation [11], the Eg value for Me, the reference substituent, will of course be 0. All substituents other than H have -ve Es values because all substituents other than H are larger than Me, and the rate of hydrolysis of any ester RCOzEt (R/H) will thus be slower than that of MeC02Et, in a reaction whose rate is governed solely by the steric effect of R. It is found in practice that the value of the steric parameter, Eg, for a particular group, R, differs to some extent from one reaction to another. This is not altogether surprising as both the local environ- ment of R and the size of the attacking reagent will vary from one reaction to another. It means, however, that on incorporating Eg into the Hammett type equation, [12], it is necessary to introduce a yet further parameter, S, as a measure of a particular reaction’s log-^ = p*o-R + SEs [12] susceptibility towards steric effects. In that sense 6 is the steric parallel to p*—which measures the reaction’s susceptibility towards polar effects. The 8 parameter is given the value 100 for acid- catalysed ester hydrolysis, as the standard reaction, and its value for other reactions can then be determined experimentally in the usual way.", "doc_name": "Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "page": 393, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Reaction Mechanism\\Peter Sykes Organic Chem Mechanism.pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}
{"text": "388 Linear free energy relationships Now that steric parameters have been introduced in this way, the treatment can be extended to include the reactions of o-substituted benzene derivatives as well. Thus for the acid-catalysed hydrolysis of o-substituted benzamides (43), the value of S is found to be 0-81; so this reaction is apparently slightly less susceptible to the steric (43) effect of substituents than is the standard reaction, the acid- catalysed hydrolysis of o-substituted esters. In general, attempts to quantify o-substitituent effects have not, however, been very suc- cessful. We are here, once again, faced with some dilemma as we were with the Yukawa-Tsuno equation (p. 374): how far does any additional information gained merit the very considerable effort involved in the experimental evaluation of such further parameters in the first place? 13.6 SOLVENT EFFECTS One of the things our discussion of linear free energy relationship has not yet made any endeavour to take into account is the role played in reactions by the solvent. This despite the fact that the very great majority of organic reactions do take place in solution, with the solvent often playing a crucial role. 13.6.1 Change of p with solvent It is, of course, true that some implicit consideration is given to the solvent in that the p value for a particular reaction is found to change when the solvent in which the reaction is carried out is changed: Reaction AiC02H(44) + H20?^ATC0f(45) + H30® (H^O) ” + >> ” + ” (50% aq.

As the solvent is changed from water, with a dielectric constant of 79, to ethanol, with a dielectric constant of only 24, there will be a marked decrease in advantageous solvation of the charged anion (45) with respect to the uncharged acid (44). The relative impor- tance of the polar effect exerted by electron-withdrawing sub- stituents, in overall stabilisation of the carboxylate anion (i.e. in acid-strengthening: increasing K^, will therefore increase as the dielectric constant of the solvent decreases. The value of p, the susceptibility of the reaction to the polar effect of a substituent, will also increase, therefore, on changing the solvent from water to ethanol. 13.6.2 Gnuiwald-Winstein equation Attempts to correlate the differing rate of a particular reaction, when carried out in a range of different solvents, with the dielectric constant values for these solvents have not proved very rewarding. Attempts have therefore been made to establish empirical reactivity/solvent correlations along general Hammett lines. Among the more significant of these attempts has been that of Grunwald and Winstein on the solvolysis of halides. They sought to establish a solvent parameter, designated Y, which would correlate with the different rate constants found for solvolysis of the same halide in a range of different solvents.

But specific solvation of the separating charges must also be involved and Ya will reflect those, and quite possibly other properties of the solvent as well. It is common to describe Ya as representing a measure of the ‘ionising power’ of the solvent A.

Thus, ion-pair formation is known to be well advanced in the transition state for S^, 1 solvolysis of 2-chloro- 2-methylpropane (46), the standard halide, for which m = 1-00. Not altogether surprisingly the value of m for 1-bromo-l-phenylethane (48), in which the developing benzyl type cation, [PhCHMe]®, is stabilised by delocalisation of its +ve charge over the rr-system of the attached benzene nucleus {cf. p. 84), is even larger—at 1-20. By contrast, the m values for the primary halides, bromoethane (49) and 1-bromobutane (50), are much lower—0-34 and 0-33, respec- tively. These values, indicating low susceptibility towards the ionis- ing pK)wer of the solvent, are characteristic of halides whose sol- volysis is known to proceed via the 8^,2 pathway. In general, an m value of 0-5 can be taken as an approximate indicator of an Sn1/Sn 2 mechanistic borderline in solvolysis reactions of this kind. The major defect of the Grunwald-Winstein treatment is that it is limited in its scope.

Particularly large shifts were observed with the zwitterion (51), whose absorption maximum was found to vary between 450 and 1000 nm, depending on the solvent: its solution being yellow in MeOH, red in MezCHOH, and blue in CHCI3!

We have already mentioned (p. 359) the relationship between free energy change, AG, and log k or log K\\ and each AG term is, of course, made up of an enthalpy, AH, and an entropy, AS, component: Equilibrium AG® = -2-303 RT log K AG®=AH®-TAS® AG+ = -2-303 RT log k— = AH+ -TAS+ [ k' = Boltzmann’s constant] h = Planck’s constant J Looking back at one of our earliest examples—Fig. 13.3 (p. 361) in which log K for the ionisation of ArC02H is plotted against log k for the base-catalysed hydrolysis of ArC02Et—the straight line implies that there is also a linear relationship between the AG^ values for the former reaction and the AG'*' values for the latter. Such a straight line relationship between these two series of AG terms is to be expected only if, for each series, one or other of the following conditions is satisfied: (1) AH is linearly related to AS for the series (2) AH is constant for the series (3) AS is constant for the series Any of these conditions constitutes an extremely stringent limita- tion, and there has always been some doubt expressed over the extent to which any one of them is indeed satisfied in reactions which nevertheless give quite good straight line Hammett plots: thereby making the linear relationships that are observed all the more mysterious!

Interestingly enough, doubt has in the past been expressed as to whether even the standard, reference reaction—the aqueous dissociation of m- and p-substituted benzoic acids in water at 25°—satisfied this condition. A major obstacle to deciding the truth or otherwise of this assertion about benzoic acid ionisation has been the experimental difficulties involved in making the necessary measurements. The solubility of the acids in water is pretty low, and their AH^ values are very small, with consequent imprecision in, and unreliability of, the results so obtained. Relatively recently, however, AG®, AH® and AS® have been redetermined, with great precision, for a series of ten m- and p-substituted benzoic acids. Using these data, stringently linear plots were obtained for AH® against AS®, for AG® against AH®, and for AG® against AS®. So it looks as though Hammett was on to a good thing after all when he made his choice of standard, reference reaction in the first place! It is important, however, to remember that what theoretical interpretation there has been of the Hammett equation has come from circumstantial evidence rather than by rigorous proof. It remains an empirical relationship and, to that extent, there is no point in even trying to evaluate ctx and p to several places of decimals. The sort of information we need, as an aid to the elucidation of reaction pathways, is of an ‘order of magnitude’ kind: such things as whether p is +ve or -ve, whether its value is large or small, whether there are noticeable deviations from linearity in plots of cTx against log kx and, if so, of what kind. This also raises the question of multi-parameter equations, not so much of their general validity but of their actual usefulness. While they are certainly of considerable interest to physical organic chemists, it is more doubtful—so far as practising organic chemists in general are concerned—whether the extra labour, necessarily involved in evaluating all these further parameters, is repaid by the quality of the additional information that is thereby gained: you pays your money and you takes your choice! Having said all that, it is equally important to remember that the number and variety of useful correlations to which Hammett plots have given rise is quite astonishing, particularly when we consider the simplicity and convenience of the approach.

{"text": "Engineering Chemistry WATER INTRODUCTION Water is the nature’s most wonderful, abundant and useful compound. Of the many essential elements for the existence of human beings, animals and plants, water is rated to be of greatest importance. Without food human being can survive for a number of days, but water is such an essential thing without it one cannot survive. Water is not only essential for the lives of animals and plants but also occupies unique position in industries. Probably its most important use as an engineering material is in the ‘steam generation’. Water is also used as a coolant, in power, and chemical plants. In addition to it, water can also be used in the production of steel, rayon, paper, textiles, chemicals, irrigation, drinking firefighting, etc. OCCURRENCE: Water is the only substance that occurs at ordinary temperatures in all three states of matter: Solid, Liquid and Gas. As a solid ice, it forms glaciers, frozen lakes and rivers, snow, frost. It is liquid as rain and dew, and it covers three- quarters of the earth’s surface in swamps, lakes, rivers and oceans. Water also occurs in the soil and beneath the earth’s surface as a vast groundwater reservoir. As gas, or water vapour, it occurs as fog, steam and clouds. CHARACTERISTICS OF WATER As per the suggestion given by World Health Organisation (WHO) and by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the following are the important characteristics of potable water. 1. It should be clear, colourless and odourless. 2. It should be free from harmful bacteria and suspended impurities. 3. It should be free from dissolved gases like CO2, H2S, NH3, etc., and poisonous minerals like lead, arsenic, manganese, etc., 4. Hardness should be less than 500 ppm. 5. Chloride ion content should be less than 250 ppm. 6. Fluoride ion content should be less than 1.5 ppm. 7. Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) content should be less than 500 ppm. 8. pH of the potable water should be 6.5 – 8.5.", "doc_name": "Study Material (3).pdf", "page": 1, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Water\\Study Material (3).pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}
{"text": "Engineering Chemistry CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF WATER The most important chemical characteristics of water are its acidity, alkalinity, hardness and corrosiveness. Chemical impurities can be either natural, man-made (Industrial) or be deployed in raw water sources by enemy forces. Some chemical impurities cause water to behave as either an acid or a base. Since either condition has an important bearing on the water treatment process, the pH value must be determined. Generally the pH influences the corrosiveness of the water, chemical dosages necessary for proper disinfection and the ability to detect contaminants. HARDNESS Hardness of water is that characteristic property which prevents the lathering of soap. It is caused by the soluble salts of calcium, magnesium, iron, manganese and other heavy metal ions. The degree of hardness depends on the type and amount of impurities present in the water. Hardness also depends on the amount of carbon-di-oxide in solution. Carbon-di-oxide influences the solubility of the impurities that cause hardness. When a sample of hard water treated with soap it does not produce lather. It forms a white precipitate or SCUM. Soap is sodium salt of higher fatty acid like oleic or palmitic or stearic acid. SOFT WATER Soft water produces lather readily when treated with soap solution. This is due to the absence of salts of metal ions. How to detect hardness? When the water is treated with soap solution, if it prevents lathering and forms white scum, the water contains hardness. Water containing hardness gives wine red colour with Eriochrome Black –T indicator.", "doc_name": "Study Material (3).pdf", "page": 2, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Water\\Study Material (3).pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}
{"text": "Engineering Chemistry The total water hardness (including both Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions) is read as parts per million (ppm) or weight / volume (mg/L) of Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3) in the water. Although water hardness usually measures only the total concentrations of calcium and magnesium (the two most prevalent, divalent metal ions), iron, aluminum and manganese may also be present at elevated levels in some geographical locations. The predominant source of magnesium is dolomite (CaMg (CO3)2). TYPES OF HARDNESS Depending upon the types of dissolved salts present in water, hardness of water can be classified into two types: Temporary Hardness Permanent Hardness Temporary Hardness (or) Carbonate Hardness (CH) (or) Alkaline Hardness Temporary hardness is caused by carbonate, bicarbonate and hydroxide of calcium and magnesium ions in the water. It can be removed by boiling water or by the addition of lime (Ca(OH)2) Boiling promotes the formation of carbonate from the bicarbonate and precipitates calcium carbonate out of solution, leaving water that is softer upon coving. Ca (HCO3)2→ CaCO3 ↓+ H2O + CO2 Permanent Hardness (or) Non – Carbonate Hardness (NCH) (or) Non – alkaline Hardness Permanent hardness is hardness (mineral content) that cannot be removed by boiling. It is usually caused by the presence of sulphates, chlorides, nitrates of calcium and magnesium and other metal ions which become more soluble on boiling. Despite the name, permanent hardness can be removed using water – softener or ion-exchange column, where the calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged with the sodium ions in the column. It can be removed by Lime – Soda process Zeolite process", "doc_name": "Study Material (3).pdf", "page": 3, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem\\Water\\Study Material (3).pdf", "subject": "Chemistry", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

It chokes the pipe by getting accumulated at corners and turn. Scale Formation Scales are hard deposits which sticks firmly to the inner surface of boiler. It is difficult to remove even with the help of hammer and chisel. It causes fuel wastage , lowering safety and explosion of boilers. Caustic Embrittlement ‘Caustic embrittlement is a type of boiler corrosion which makes boiler material brittle’. This is caused by highly alkaline water in boiler in the boiler. During lime soda process free Na2CO3 is usually present in small proportion which decomposed to NaOH under pressure. The water containing NaOH flows into minute hair cracks by capillary action where water evaporates and concentration of NaOH increases progressively.This caustic soda aatckks the metals thereby dissolving the iron in the form of sodium ferroate. This causes embrittlement of boiler parts. Na2CO3 + H2O ------> 2 NaOH + CO2 2 NaOH + Fe ------> Na2FeO2 + H2 Sodium hypoferrite 6 Na2FeO2 + 6 H2O + O2 ------> 12 NaOH + 2 Fe3O4 (Black rust) Caustic embrittlement can be avoided by 1. By using sodium phosphate as a softening agent instead of sodium carbonate. 2. By adding tannin or lignin to the boiler water, since these substances block the hair cracks, thereby preventing the infiltration of the caustic soda solution in to these. 3. By adding sodium sulphate to boiler water: Sodium sulphate blocks the hair cracks preventing the infiltration of caustic soda solution in to these. It has been observed that caustic cracking can be prevented. SOFTENING METHODS Water used for industrial purposes (such as for steam generation) should be sufficiently pure.

Thus wine red colour retained.

What is biodiesel and how is it produced? Biodiesel is defined as a diesel fuel substitute derived from renewable resources, specifically a family of products known as alkyl esters of fatty acids, created from vegetable oils or animal fats in combination with alcohol. It is commonly produced through a process called transesterification and can be sourced from materials such as rapeseed oil, soybean oil, recycled cooking oils, and microalgae. 2. What role does NaOH play in this reaction? In this reaction, NaOH plays the role of a catalyst. 3. Why is methanol used in excess? Methanol is used in excess due to the nature of equilibrium and reversibility of the biodiesel production reaction. the excess methanol is employed to favor a more complete reaction to achieve a higher quality product. 4. How does this experiment follow green chemistry principles? Usage of renewable feedstocks like vegetable oils or animal fats instead of fossil fuels to create energy is sustainable for the environment. The usage of NaOH catalyst follows the principle of using catalytic reagents rather than stoichiometric reagents. Biodiesel is considered a green fuel because it can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional fossil fuels. It also can break down naturally in the environment over time since it is a biodegradable fuel, unlike petroleum based fuels that persist in the environment for longer periods. Thus, synthesis of biodiesel and consequently this experiment follows green chemistry principles. 5. What are the by-products of the reaction? The product generates by-products of crude glycerol, soap, excess alcohol, and small amounts of water.", "doc_name": "EXP 4 BIODIESEL PRODUCTIOn.pdf", "page": 5, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Chem Lab\\EXP 4 BIODIESEL PRODUCTIOn.pdf", "subject": "Chemistry-LAB", "category": "LAB", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

{"text": "KJSCE – SVU COMPLEX NUMBERS SEM-I Applied Mathematics – I 1 COMPLEX NUMBERS INTRODUCTION A complex number z is an ordered pair (x, y) of real numbers x and y. It is written as 𝑧 = (𝑥, 𝑦) or 𝑧 = 𝑥 + 𝑖 𝑦, where i = √−1 is known as imaginary unit. Here, x is called the Real part of z and is written as “Re (z)” and y is called the Imaginary part of z and is written as “Im(z)”. If x = 0 and y ≠ 0, then 𝑧 = 0 + 𝑖 𝑦 which is purely imaginary. If x ≠ 0 and y = 0, then 𝑧 = 𝑥 + 𝑖 0 = 𝑥 which is purely real Hence z is purely imaginary if its real part is zero and is real if its imaginary part is zero. This shows that every real number can be written in the form of a complex number by taking its imaginary part as zero. Hence the set of real numbers is contained in the set of complex numbers. POWERS OF 𝒊: We know that 𝑖= √−1 , 𝑖2 = 𝑖× 𝑖 = − 1, 𝑖3 = 𝑖2 × 𝑖 = − 𝑖 , 𝑖4 = (𝑖2)2 = (− 1)2 = 1, 𝑖5 = 𝑖 × 𝑖4 = 𝑖 etc. Even power of 𝑖 is either 1 or −1 and odd power of 𝑖 is either 𝑖 or – 𝑖. EQUALITY OF COMPLEX NUMBER: If 𝑧1 = 𝑧2 then, 𝑥1 + 𝑖 𝑦1 = 𝑥2 + 𝑖 𝑦2 Comparing real and imaginary parts 𝑥1 = 𝑥2 and 𝑦1 = 𝑦2 This shows that two complex numbers are equal if and only if their corresponding real and imaginary parts are equal. CONJUGATE OF COMPLEX NUMBER: If 𝑧 = 𝑥 + 𝑖 𝑦 is a complex number then its conjugate or complex conjugate is defined as 𝑧 = 𝑥 – 𝑖 𝑦. Also 𝑧 𝑧̅ = (𝑥 + 𝑖 𝑦) (𝑥 – 𝑖 𝑦) = 𝑥2 + 𝑦2 Note: To write the conjugate of a complex number, replace 𝑖 by – 𝑖 in the complex number. ALGEBRA OF COMPLEX NUMBER: Let 𝑧1 = 𝑥1 + 𝑖 𝑦1 and 𝑧2 = 𝑥2 + 𝑖 𝑦2 are two complex numbers. Then (a) Addition: 𝑧1 + 𝑧2 = (𝑥1 + 𝑖 𝑦1) + (𝑥2 + 𝑖 𝑦2) = (𝑥1 + 𝑥2) + 𝑖 (𝑦1 + 𝑦2)", "doc_name": "1_COMPLEX NUMBERS- REVIEW.pdf", "page": 1, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Maths\\Complex\\1_COMPLEX NUMBERS- REVIEW.pdf", "subject": "Applied mathematics-I", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

Argand’s Diagram: We know that the real numbers can be represented by point on a line in such a way that corresponding to every real number, there is one and only one point on the line and corresponding to every point on the line, there is one and only one real number. Similarly, we can represent a complex number as follows: Consider a complex number 𝑧= 𝑥+ 𝑖𝑦, where 𝑥, 𝑦∈𝑅 and 𝑖= √−1. Draw the coordinate axes. Since 𝑥∈𝑅, 𝑥 can be represented by the point (𝑥,0) on the X-axis. Since 𝑦∈𝑅, 𝑦 can be represented by the point (0, 𝑦) on the Y-axis. Then the point (𝑥,𝑦) represents the complex number 𝑥+ 𝑖𝑦, i.e., 𝑥+ 𝑖𝑦= (𝑥, 𝑦) Such a representation of complex numbers by points in a plane is called Argand’s diagram. The horizontal x-axis is called the real axis, vertical y-axis is called the imaginary axis and xy-plane is called complex plane. We observe that the point representing a complex number can be on any of the coordinate axes or in any of the quadrants. The complex number 𝑧= 0 + 0𝑖 i.e., the zero complex number is represented by the origin. 2. Geometrical Meaning of Modulus and Argument: If 𝑧= 𝑥+ 𝑦𝑖 is a complex number, then the modulus of 𝑧 is |𝑧| = √𝑥2 + 𝑦2 Let the point 𝑃(𝑥, 𝑦) represents the complex number 𝑧= 𝑥+ 𝑦𝑖 ∴|𝑧| = √𝑥2 + 𝑦2 = 𝑂𝑃 Hence, modulus of 𝑧 is the distance of the point P from the origin where P represents the complex number 𝑧 in the plane.

Argument 𝜃 has infinite number of values. The value of 𝜃 lying between –𝜋 and 𝜋 is called the principal value of Argument. POLAR FORM OF A COMPLEX NUMBER: Let a complex number 𝑧= 𝑥+ 𝑖𝑦 be represented by the point 𝑃(𝑥, 𝑦). Then 𝑂𝑃= 𝑟= √𝑥2 + 𝑦2 𝑖s called the modulus of the complex number 𝑧= 𝑥+ 𝑖𝑦 and is denoted by |𝑧|. Thus |𝑧| = |𝑥+ 𝑖𝑦| = √𝑥2 + 𝑦2 If the ray OP makes an angle 𝜃 with the positive X-axis, then this angle 𝜃 is called the argument of 𝑧 and is denoted by 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑧 (if 𝑧≠0) From the figure 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑧 is given by the equations: cos 𝜃= 𝑥 |𝑧| = 𝑥 √𝑥2+𝑦2 = 𝑥 𝑟 and sin 𝜃= 𝑦 |𝑧| = 𝑦 √𝑥2+𝑦2 = 𝑦 𝑟 ∴𝑥= 𝑟cos𝜃 and 𝑦= 𝑟sin 𝜃 Hence 𝑧= 𝑥+ 𝑖𝑦 can be written as 𝑧= 𝑟cos 𝜃+ 𝑖(𝑟sin 𝜃) = 𝑟(cos𝜃+ 𝑖sin 𝜃) This is called polar representation of 𝑧, where 𝑟= √𝑥2 + 𝑦2 and 𝜃= tan−1(𝑦𝑥 ⁄ ) Polar form of 𝒙+ 𝒊𝒚 for different sings of 𝒙,𝒚 : Let 𝑧= 𝑥+ 𝑖𝑦 be a complex number Let 𝑧= 𝑟(cos 𝜃+ 𝑖sin 𝜃) be its polar form. Then modulus of 𝑧, i.e., |𝑧| = √𝑥2 + 𝑦2 and amplitude of 𝑧 is 𝜃. We have find to the value of 𝜃 for different signs of 𝑥 and 𝑦, i.e., for different position of the point 𝑃(𝑥,𝑦).

{"text": "KJSCE – SVU COMPLEX NUMBERS SEM-I Applied Mathematics – I 4 Remark: 1. To find the amplitude of 𝑧= 𝑥+ 𝑖𝑦, if 𝑃(𝑥, 𝑦) does not lie in the quadrant but it lies on either of the coordinate axes (i) If 𝑃(𝑥,𝑦) lies on positive side of X-axis, i.e., 𝑥> 0, 𝑦= 0 (e.g. 𝑧= 3), then amp (𝑧) = 0 (ii) If 𝑃(𝑥,𝑦) lies on negative side of X-axis, i.e., 𝑥< 0,𝑦= 0 (e.g. 𝑧= −3), then amp (𝑧) = 𝜋 (iii) If 𝑃(𝑥,𝑦) lies on positive side of Y-axis, i.e., 𝑥= 0, 𝑦> 0 (e.g. 𝑧= 5𝑖), then amp (𝑧) = 𝜋2 ⁄ (iv) If 𝑃(𝑥,𝑦) lies on negative side of Y-axis, i.e., 𝑥= 0,𝑦< 0 (e.g. 𝑧= −5𝑖), then amp (𝑧) = 3𝜋 2 (v) If 𝑧= 0, then 𝑟= 0 and amp (𝑧) is not defined 2. We may be tempted to take tan 𝜃= 𝑦𝑥 ⁄ , if 𝑥≠0. But this will not give us unique value of 𝜃. If tan 𝜃> 0, then 𝜃 may be in the first or third quadrant and if tan 𝜃< 0, then 𝜃 may be in the second or fourth quadrant. Hence, it is not advisable to take tan 𝜃= 𝑦𝑥 ⁄ or 𝜃= tan−1(𝑦𝑥 ⁄ ). Therefore, we have to obtain the value of 𝜃 using the equations cos 𝜃= 𝑥 𝑟= 𝑥 |𝑧| and sin 𝜃= 𝑦 𝑟= 𝑦 |𝑧| Case (i): If 𝑥> 0, 𝑦> 0, then 𝑃(𝑥, 𝑦) lies in the first quadrant. In this case 0 < 𝜃< 𝜋 2 Case (ii): If 𝑥< 0, 𝑦> 0, then 𝑃(𝑥, 𝑦) lies in the second quadrant. In this case 𝜋 2 < 𝜃< 𝜋 Case (iii): If 𝑥< 0, 𝑦< 0, then 𝑃(𝑥, 𝑦) lies in the third quadrant. In this case 𝜋< 𝜃< 3𝜋 2 Case (iv): If 𝑥> 0, 𝑦< 0, then 𝑃(𝑥, 𝑦) lies in the fourth quadrant. In this case 3𝜋 2 < 𝜃< 2𝜋 EXPONENTIAL FORM OF A COMPLEX NUMBER: We know 𝑒𝑖𝜃= cos𝜃+ 𝑖sin 𝜃.

{"text": "KJSCE-SVU AM-II Applied Mathematics-II 1 EXACT DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS: Definition : A differential equation which is obtained from its primitive differentiation only and without any operation of elimination or reduction is called an exact differential equation. If 𝑢 = 𝑐 where u is a function of x and y is primitive then 𝑑𝑢= 𝜕𝑢 𝜕𝑥𝑑𝑥+ 𝜕𝑢 𝜕𝑦𝑑𝑦= 0 is an exact differential equation. Thus, an exact differential equation is obtained from its promitive by equating its total differential to zero. For example, If 𝑢 = 𝑥2 + 𝑦2 = 𝑐 then 𝑑𝑢= 𝜕𝑢 𝜕𝑥𝑑𝑥+ 𝜕𝑢 𝜕𝑦𝑑𝑦= 2𝑥𝑑𝑥+ 2𝑦𝑑𝑦 Equating 𝑑𝑢 = 0, we get the equation 𝑥 𝑑𝑥 + 𝑦 𝑑𝑦 = 0 which is exact. The Necessary and Sufficient Condition for equation 𝑴𝒅𝒙 + 𝑵𝒅𝒚 = 𝟎 to be exact is 𝝏𝑴 𝝏𝒚= 𝝏𝑵 𝝏𝒙 i.e. If the equation 𝑀 𝑑𝑥 + 𝑁 𝑑𝑦 = 0 is exact, then 𝝏𝑴 𝝏𝒚= 𝝏𝑵 𝝏𝒙 and conversely if 𝝏𝑴 𝝏𝒚= 𝝏𝑵 𝝏𝒙 then 𝑀 𝑑𝑥 + 𝑁 𝑑𝑦 = 0 is exact. Rule for finding the solution: Rule 1: Integrate 𝑀 w.r.t 𝑥 treating 𝑦 constant and Integrate only those terms in 𝑁 which are free from 𝑥 w.r.t. 𝑦. Equate the sum to a constant. This is the solution.

DEGREE: The degree of differential equation is the degree of the highest order derivative occurring in it, when the D.E is so written that the derivative are free from negative or fractional indices. Remark: The order and the degree of D.E are positive integers. Hence, in order to find the order and degree of a given D.E we have to remove the negative or fractional indices, if they occur in the D.E EXAMPLES OF ORDER AND DEGREE 1.

For different values of C, we get different functions, differing only by a constant. The graphs of these functions give us an infinite family of curves such that at the points on these curves with the same x-coordinate, the tangents are parallel as they have the same slope φ'(x) = f(x). Consider the integral of 1/2√x i.e., ∫1/2√xdx = √x + C, C ∈ R Above figure shows some members of the family of curves given by y = + C for different C ∈ R. Comparison between Differentiation and Integration (i) Both differentiation and integration are linear operator on functions as d/dx {af(x) ± bg(x)} = a d/dx{f(x) ± d/dx{g(x)} and ∫[a.f(x) ± b.g(x)dx = a ∫f(x)dx ± b ∫g(x)dx (ii) All functions are not differentiable, similarly there are some function which are not integrable. (iii) Integral of a function is always discussed in an interval but derivative of a function can be discussed in a interval as well as on a point. (iv) Geometrically derivative of a function represents slope of the tangent to the graph of function at the point. On the other hand, integral of a function represents an infinite family of curves placed parallel to each other having parallel tangents at points of intersection of the curves with a line parallel to Y-axis.", "doc_name": "Integral formulae substitutions and tricks.pdf", "page": 3, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Maths\\Prerequisite Topics, (rules & formulae)\\Integral formulae substitutions and tricks.pdf", "subject": "Applied mathematics-I", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

If f(x) and g(x) be two integrable functions, then (i) We use the following preferential order for taking the first function. Inverse→ Logarithm→ Algebraic → Trigonometric→ Exponential. In short we write it HATE. (ii) If one of the function is not directly integrable, then we take it a the first function. (iii) If only one function is there, i.e., ∫log x dx, then 1 (unity) is taken as second function.

If degree of f(x) < degree of g(x), then f(x) / g(x) is called a proper rational function. (ii) If degree of f(x) ≥ degree of g(x), then f(x) /g(x) is called an improper g(x) rational function. (iii) If f(x) / g(x) isan improper rational function, then we divide f(x) by g(x) g(x) and convert it into a proper rational function as f(x) / g(x) = φ(x) + h(x) / g(x). (iv) Any proper rational function f(x) / g(x) can be expressed as the sum of rational functions each having a simple factor of g(x).

{"text": "Prepared by: Dr. Suren Patwardhan Page 1 of 18 F Y B Tech 2021-22\\Engg. Physics Module 3 QUANTUM MECHANICS – NOTES (As per SVU-R2020 Scheme & Syllabus)  Introduction Quantum mechanics emerged out of a process to reformulate our concepts and understanding of the nature. Most of our technological applications are still based on the traditional “classical physics” consisting of wave motion, mechanics, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, optics etc. However, the quantum mechanical approach becomes essential as we probe further and further into the nature; particularly for studying the world of “very small”. Masses, dimensions and other physical parameters of objects in this world are orders of magnitudes smaller than our “everyday-life” world. More importantly, these “very small” objects are beyond our senses either directly or even indirectly through instruments. How can we develop the trajectory of a proton if we can’t actually see it like a stone going up and coming down? Moreover, we have a tendency to visualize any object by our common preconception. For example, when we talk about an electron, we tend to give it a spherical, ball-bearing type look. But how do we know that it’s a particle if we can’t see to it? Facing to very small masses, very small dimensions and a large ensemble of such “identical, indistinguishable” objects (e.g. electrons in a conductor), statistical interpretation becomes inherent in quantum mechanics. Results are given in terms of “probability functions” rather than “deterministic” laws of traditional sciences. Values of physical quantities such as position, energy, momentum etc. are expressed as “most probable distribution” instead of an exact value. This should not be regarded as the shortfall of the theory because the so-called “deterministic” laws of macroscopic world can be shown as an approximation of the quantum mechanical treatment in the limit of large values of physical parameters. Quantum physics is in fact, the “superset” of all of classical sciences.  Background It would be relevant to discuss some of the important findings that changed the gears of physics at the beginning of the 20th century. Classical physics could not account for many of the experimental findings carried out at that time. Some of them were as follows: 1) Blackbody radiation catastrophe: By and large, the Planck’s formula for blackbody radiation is considered as the birthplace of quantum physics. It used a novel concept of assuming every matter as made of small oscillating particles (oscillators) and that the energy emitted by their ensemble be in discrete manner rather than at any arbitrary value (continuous). The formula exactly matched with the experimental results at any wavelength and the discreteness of energy was established. 2) Specific heats of solids at low temperatures. 3) Constituents of matter, stability of atoms. 4) Origin of atomic and molecular spectra. 5) Fine structure and hyperfine structure splitting of spectral lines in magnetic field. 6) Wide range of conductivity of solids (10-14 S/m to 108 S/m). 7) Origin of magnetism, wide range of magnetisation (109 A/m to 10-6 A/m) and spontaneous magnetisation of ferromagnetic", "doc_name": "Prof. Surens Notes on Quantum Mechanics.pdf", "page": 1, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 3 Quantum Mechanics\\Prof. Surens Notes on Quantum Mechanics.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

The events indicated above are essentially before de’Broglie put forward his hypothesis. Heisenberg (1925) and Schrödinger (1926) independently developed core theories of quantum mechanics. Later, Dirac (1928) contrived a general formalism and also included relativistic extensions to it. Since then there has been a continuous development in the quantum mechanics at atomic, nuclear and elementary particle scales but discussion on this development is beyond the scope of the syllabus.  de’Broglie’s hypothesis Louis de’Broglie tried to sum up the experimental finding by his time into a set of logical arguments based on symmetry. Energy in the universe is manifested in two forms viz radiation and matter. By then, it was known that radiation shows both, particle properties and wave properties. de’broglie then argued that why can’t matter, which is supposed to be made of particles and mostly governed by the laws of Newtonian mechanics, exhibit wave nature? Following chart can be useful to understand de’Broglie’s arguments: At that time, there was no experimental basis to his hypothesis but many took it seriously and soon wave nature of electrons, presumed as perfect particles was demonstrated by two independent experiments; one by Davison and Germer and the other by G P Thomson. Both these experiments were very similar to X-ray diffraction and based on diffraction of electrons by using crystals as three dimensional diffraction gratings. Prior to this, it was already established that particle aspect of radiation called as “photons” are governed by two important equations: E = hν = hc λ Also, E = mc2 = (mc)c = pc ⇒ hc λ = pc or λ = h p", "doc_name": "Prof. Surens Notes on Quantum Mechanics.pdf", "page": 2, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 3 Quantum Mechanics\\Prof. Surens Notes on Quantum Mechanics.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}
{"text": "Prepared by: Dr. Suren Patwardhan Page 3 of 18 F Y B Tech 2021-22\\Engg. Physics De Broglie extended this equation to all material particles having mass “m” and moving with speed “v”, so the matter has an associated wave whose wavelength can be estimated as λ = h mv (v < c always) (1) This relation is called de’Broglie equation. Note that this equation connects two physical quantities which are usually not used together because the momentum is a typical particle parameter while the wavelength is a typical wave parameter. The notions of a particle and a wave as we learn describe them as opposite to each other. By “particle” we imagine a localized, concise entity and which can be obtained in a discrete fashion while by a “wave” we try to imagine a distributed entity continuous all over. For example, the ocean wave hits the shore simultaneously all over but a marble can hit only at a particular point at a time. For a particle having kinetic energy K, the de’Broglie wavelength can be written as λ = h √2mK as K = p2 2m = Kinetic energy acquired (2) For a charged particle of charge “q” accelerated through a potential difference of “V”, λ = h √2mqV as qV = Potential energy gained (3)  Experimental verification of de’Broglie’s hypothesis - The Davison-Germer Experiment An important demonstration of diffraction of electrons was given by Davison and Germer and independently by G P Thomson in 1927. These experiments confirmed de’Broglie’s hypothesis and consequently, the wave nature of material particles. The demonstration is considered to be one of the important experiments in the development of quantum mechanics. If electrons have wave nature, they should also exhibit diffraction effect. With an electron gun, electrons at energy 50 – 100 eV can easily be obtained. At this energy, according to de’Broglie equation, electrons should have wavelength of a few angstrom. So crystals can act as diffraction grating for electrons also in the same manner they act for X-ray diffraction. Experimental set-up: In the actual experiment, Davison and Germer selected a nickel crystal. A collimated beam of monoenergetic electrons is obtained by an arrangement consisting of electron gun, set of anodes, collimating slits and variable voltage source. The crystal can be rotated on its axis. A detector was placed in the scattering direction, which can also be rotated in accordance to the rotation of the crystal. The detector was attached with a scale to measure angle of scattering (φ) and hence to deduce the glancing angle (θ). Experiment: Electrons emitted from a hot tungsten filament after getting accelerated and focused fall on the nickel crystal. Electrons scattered from the crystal are collected at the detector, which produces the count in different directions with respect to the incident beam. The intensity of scattering (detector count) is plotted as a function of scattering angle for different values of accelerating voltage (V).", "doc_name": "Prof. Surens Notes on Quantum Mechanics.pdf", "page": 3, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 3 Quantum Mechanics\\Prof. Surens Notes on Quantum Mechanics.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

{"text": "Prepared by: Dr. Suren Patwardhan Page 4 of 18 F Y B Tech 2021-22\\Engg. Physics Investigations: Davison and Germer found that the detector current, which in turn depends upon intensity of scattered electrons increased significantly at certain angle of scattering and at certain values of accelerating voltage. In a particular observation, they found maximum detector current corresponding to scattering angle of 50° for accelerating voltage of 54 volt. With reference to the selected orientation of the nickel crystal (lattice planes), this scattering angle corresponded to glancing angle of 65°. The detector current was very low and random at different angle of scattering. This suggested that there is certain kind of preference to a particular glancing angle when the electrons scatter from the crystal. This could only be explained if is assumed that electrons have a wave nature and obey the Bragg’s law viz 2d sin = n. Calculations: The interplanar spacing (d) for the selected orientation of nickel crystal as obtained from X-ray analysis was 0.91 Å. The glancing angle for which, maximum count obtained was 65°. Using Bragg’s law, it gives wavelength of possible waves as λ = 2d sin θ n . The scattering angle corresponded to the first order of diffraction maximum. Hence, 𝜆= 2 × 0.91 × sin 65 = 1.65 Å. Assuming de’Broglie’ hypothesis to be correct, Davison and Germer estimated the wavelength of electron waves using de’Broglie equation 𝛌= 𝐡 √𝟐𝐦𝐪𝐕. This yielded λ = 6.63×10−34 √2×9.1×10−31×1.6×10−19×54 = 1.67 Å, in excellent closeness to that obtained from the Bragg’s law. Thus, de’Broglie equation indeed has significance and wave nature of matter was established experimentally for the first time. Further confirmation: The experiment carried independently by G. P. Thomson also confirmed the wave nature of electrons. Later, experiments were performed by using beams of other particle such as protons, neutrons and alpha particles, which also agreed perfectly with the theoretical predictions. Similar experiments were done using heavier ions to prove that wave nature is not restricted only to elementary particles but it applied virtually to all of matter. Thus, wave nature of matter was established. The Davison-Germer experiment stood as the pioneering experiment in the confirmation of quantum mechanics.  Phase velocity (wave velocity), wave packet and group velocity: The waves associated with all material particles moving with certain speed are called as “matter waves” but exactly what kind of waves are these?

Traditionally, the rate at which the plane containing waves having the same phase (viz. the wave front) advances in a certain direction is called the phase velocity. It is the same as the wave velocity in ordinary sense in a wave motion. Thus, vphase = ω k; Where ω = 2πν and k = 2π λ ∴vphase = ν λ = E h × h p = E p = mc2 mv = c2 v > c! as v < c always. Here, “v” is particle velocity in the traditional sense. Estimation above gives an unusual and absurd result that the wave associated with particle moves with an extraordinary velocity leaving the particle far behind. Since this is impossible, it is concluded that particle cannot be associated with a single wave in ordinary sense. Next, it is proposed that a number of waves of different frequencies are associated with the particle. The reason for this proposal is that a large number of waves can be added and it results in a repetitive pattern called as the “wave packet”. This wave packet essentially carries the energy associated with the system (a particle; in this case). The collection of these waves is called as the wave group and the speed at which this entire group moves is different than velocities of individual waves. It is not just the average velocity but it gives the rate at which frequency varies as a function of the wave vector “k” within the group. In mathematical terms, Group velocity Vg = dω dk. Let’s estimate what is this group velocity. Let Vg = dω dk = dω dv ⁄ dk dv ⁄ ; Where, “v” is the particle velocity in traditional sense. We know that ω = 2πν ∴ω = 2πE h = 2πmc2 h = 2πm0c2 h√1−v2 c2 ⁄ ; By using Planck’s formula, Mass-energy equivalence and relativistic expression for mass. ∴ dω dv = 2πm0v h(1−v2 c2 ⁄ ) 3 2 ⁄ .

Thus the velocity with which the group moves in the form a wave packet is the same as particle velocity. So it is inferred that a particle can be represented by a wave packet.  Matter waves and their properties Since all the material particles show wavelike properties such as interference or diffraction, we try to associate wave nature to matter in general. But it should be understood that it is an entirely different concept that our usual understanding of the waves and wave motion. In introductory section it was stated that quantum mechanical treatment of solving any problem is rather statistical in nature and it involves calculation of probability factors. For example, classically, the radius of first Bohr orbit in hydrogen atom is 0.53 Ǻ exactly but according to quantum mechanics, it is just the most probable value of the radius. When we attempt to measure the radius a number of times, many times we may obtain this value but occasionally we may get some other values also. Thus, any value is expressed with some distribution about the most probable value instead of an exact value. The exact value of a physical quantity is somehow a representation of pure particle picture used in classical mechanics while the probabilistic value with some spread (often taken as the uncertainty) is a kind of wave picture used in quantum mechanics. The wave nature of matter and the concept of wave packet are linked with this probabilistic interpretation. This connection was first proposed by Max Born. In quantum mechanics, this probabilistic nature is carried by an abstract mathematical quantity called as the “wave function”.  Differences between electromagnetic waves and matter waves Electromagnetic waves Matter waves 1) Electromagnetic waves are associated with photon, which has zero rest mass. Matter waves are associated with all moving material particles having non-zero rest mass. 2) A single de’Broglie wave can be associated with the particle (photon). A single de’Broglie wave cannot be associated with the material particle. 3) The quantities those vary periodically with space and time are the electric and magnetic fields. The quantity that varies periodically with space and time is called the wave function. 4) Electric and magnetic fields are real physical quantities and can be measured experimentally. The wave function is an abstract mathematical quantity and has no direct physical interpretation. 5) Square of field amplitude gives intensity of electromagnetic waves. Square of wave function gives probability of locating the particle in a given interval.", "doc_name": "Prof. Surens Notes on Quantum Mechanics.pdf", "page": 6, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 3 Quantum Mechanics\\Prof. Surens Notes on Quantum Mechanics.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

{"text": "Prepared by: Dr. Suren Patwardhan Page 7 of 18 F Y B Tech 2021-22\\Engg. Physics  Properties of matter waves: 1) Matter waves are associated with all moving particles. 2) Their wavelength is inversely proportional to momentum of the particle. 3) They are independent of charge of the particle. 4) They are neither mechanical nor electromagnetic kind of waves. 5) A particle cannot be represented by a single wave. Instead, it is associated with a large number of waves forming a wave packet. 6) The quantity that varies periodically with space and time is taken as the wave function. 7) Square of the wave function gives probability of locating the particle.  Wave packet, wave-particle duality and the uncertainty he idea of a wave packet is central and very important in quantum mechanics. The wave packet has finite extent and it is neither “localised” like an ideal particle nor spread all over from –  to +  like an ideal wave. This leads to an idea of wave-particle dualism. By wave-particle duality it means that matter as well as radiation cannot be assigned only wave nature or only particle nature but in principle, matter as well as radiation possesses dual nature. However, at a time only one nature is exhibited and never both simultaneously. This wave-particle duality can be explained by using the concept of a wave packet as follows: 1) In quantum mechanics, all material particles are represented by a wave packet of finite extent. Mathematically, the wave packet is formed by coupling a large number of waves by means of Fourier analysis. 2) Spread of the wave packet is linked with uncertainty in the exact location of the particle. 3) Classically, a particle has an exact location at a given time. Now if we try to have exact location of the particle, the wave packet should be restricted in its extent. But, in doing so, the wave nature becomes in-deterministic. When the wave packet shrinks to a point giving exact particle picture, the wave nature collapses completely. 4) On the other hand, if we try to have a perfect wave picture, the wave packet should be extended further. But in doing so, the position of the particle and hence the particle nature itself becomes highly uncertain. When the wave packet extends to infinity giving exact wave picture, the particle nature collapses completely. Since all the material particles show wavelike properties such as interference or diffraction effects, we try to associate wave nature to particle or matter in general.  The uncertainty principle In 1927, with his matrix formulation of quantum mechanics, Heisenberg proposed the uncertainty principle. It puts forward the fundamental theoretical limit to the exact determination of physical quantities. It is particularly applicable to simultaneous measurement of certain pairs of dynamical variable. In classical physics also it was long known that certain pairs of physical quantities such as position-momentum are “non-commutative” (i.e. AB ≠ BA).

{"text": "Prepared by: Dr. Suren Patwardhan Page 8 of 18 F Y B Tech 2021-22\\Engg. Physics uncertainties of such pairs is greater than or equal to the factor h 2π ⁄ (in 2-Dimensions). In mathematical form, ∆x∆px ≥h 2π It states that “It is impossible to exactly determine the position and momentum of an object simultaneously such that the product of their uncertainties is never better that the factor h 2π ⁄ .” (In 3-Dimensions, the factor is h 4π ⁄ ”).  Other forms of Uncertainty Principle: 1. Energy-time: ∆E∆t ≥ h 2π 2. Angular position-angular momentum: ∆θ∆L ≥ h 2π At first glance, the uncertainty principle may appear to be a negation since it puts forward the fundamental limit on exact measurements. It also leads to a misunderstanding that quantum mechanical approach does not yield exact value of any dynamical variable and hence it is incomplete. But it should be understood that the limitation comes due to the process of measurement itself. The fact is that the uncertainty principle is not just applicable at microscopic levels but virtually to all kinds of measurements; macroscopic as well as microscopic. At macroscopic levels, the uncertainties in the measurements are so small that we are usually unable to detect them and the results appear to be exact. But at the microscopic levels, the uncertainties become significant as compared to the actual values and the uncertainty principle becomes necessary. Uncertainty principle is not restricted just to put fundamental limit on measurements but it proved to be far more applicable to clarify a number of theoretical gaps as well as experimental findings.  Proof-of-concept derivation for uncertainty principle Uncertainty principle first appeared through the matrix algebra developed by Heisenberg for quantum mechanics and its actual derivation is beyond the scope of this syllabus. Hence, one of the qualitative ways to arrive at the uncertainty principle is given here. Single slit diffraction of electrons – the wave picture: Here, we consider that electron is wave of wavelength λ be incident on a narrow slit of width d. Let p’ be the correspondong initial momentum of electron as per de’Broglie equation. The single narrow slit has the same effect as it would have on a monochromatic beam of light. As an electron passes through the slit, its position becomes uncertain by an amount say y. Since it can pass anywhere from the slit, we can take y  d. Further, the electron gains y-component of momentum as it can reach anywhere on the screen on either sides of central maximum B0. Let p be the momentum of electron after passing through the slit. The y-component of momentum is given by py = p sinθ. For convenience, let the electron reach at point A1 on the screen. As this point corresponds to first minimum in the diffraction pattern, it is given by an equation sinθ = λ d, where θ is angle of diffraction.", "doc_name": "Prof. Surens Notes on Quantum Mechanics.pdf", "page": 8, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 3 Quantum Mechanics\\Prof. Surens Notes on Quantum Mechanics.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

Thus, ∆y∆py ≈h, as required. Seeing an electron with a gamma-ray microscope – the particle picture: Here, we consider an electron as a perfect particle. For convenience, we assume that it is almost at rest and we try to locate its position by bouncing off a γ-ray photons from it. This γ-ray is a suitable choice, as one needs a beam having wavelength smaller than the object in order to resolve it.

The microscope is held in a direction so as to collect the scattered photon which carries the “information” of position of the electron. The formation of “image” by the photon (i.e. position of the electron) is limited by the inherent diffraction effect. The position of the electron (i.e. the “image”) has a spread equal to the width of the central maximum, which is given by ∆x ≈ λf a ----- (1) Where f is the focal length of the lens and a is aperture size. Both are microscope parameters. This value represents uncertainty in the position of the electron. Next, let the momentum imparted on the electron along the X-direction be approximately equal to the X-component of the momentum of scattered photon, which is scattered within an angle 2 towards the microscope. From the diagram, this is px = p sin θ. Taking uncertainty in the momentum of the electron Δp to be at the most equal to px, we can write, ∆p ≈p sinθ ≈ h λ sinθ. From the diagram, for very small apertures, a ≪f and sinθ = a/2 √(a/2)2+f2 ≈ a 2f. Therefore, ∆p ≈ ha 2λf ----- (2) From (1) and (2), ∆x∆p ≈ λf a × ha 2λf Thus, ∆x∆p ≈h/2, as required.  Implications of the uncertainty principle The uncertainty principle could answer many unsolved questions in different branches of physics such as nuclear, atomic and molecular, solid state, spectroscopy, astrophysics and cosmology. Creation of very short-lived elementary particles, wave-particle duality, non-existence of electrons in the nucleus, zero-point energy possessed by atoms in solids at absolute zero, finite width of spectral lines, limits of measurements of frequencies of radiations, beta-decay (emission of an electron by the nucleus), sharing of electrons in covalent bonds, exact energy value of the ground state and many other effects can be satisfactorily explained with the help of the uncertainty principle. We take a look at some common implications of the uncertainty principle. (a) non-existence of electrons in the nucleus: The maximum kinetic energies possessed by electrons during beta decay are about 100 keV. Let an electron be a part of the nucleus. The average nuclear dimensions are about 10-15 m. Taking x  10- 15 m, p  1.055 x 10-19 kg-m/s. Assuming the momentum possessed by such electron to be at least equal to uncertainty in it, p  1.055 x 10-19 kg-m/s. This electron is indeed a relativistic electron as v  c. Using the expression of kinetic energy, K = √m0 2c4 + p2c2 −m0c2. Here, (m0c2)2 ≪(pc)2. Therefore, K ≈pc = 3.165 x 10-11 J = 197.8 MeV! Electrons never have so large energy and it contradicts the experimental results. Hence the initial argument is wrong and it can be concluded that electrons cannot be constituents of the nucleus.", "doc_name": "Prof. Surens Notes on Quantum Mechanics.pdf", "page": 10, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 3 Quantum Mechanics\\Prof. Surens Notes on Quantum Mechanics.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

{"text": "Prepared by: Dr. Suren Patwardhan Page 11 of 18 F Y B Tech 2021-22\\Engg. Physics (b) Minimum energy possessed by an electron in the atom: Here, the average atomic dimensions are about 10-10 m and an electron is a part of the atom. Taking x  10-10 m, p  1.055 x 10-24 kg-m/s. Assuming the momentum possessed by such electron to be at least equal to uncertainty in it, p  1.055 x 10-24 kg-m/s. This electron is not a relativistic electron as v << c for this electron. Using the normal expression for kinetic energy, K = p2 2m, K = 6.1 x 10-19 J = 3.8 eV. It suggests that the minimum energy possessed by any electron in any atom cannot be less that 3.8 eV. Indeed, for the ground state electron in a hydrogen atom, the electron energy is 13.6 eV, which is well-above this limit. (c) Finite width of spectral lines Wavelengths (or frequencies) of radiation emitted from any monochromatic source are never sharp at a particular value but always have some “spread”, which is usually referred as “line width”. This is true even for a laser source. In spectroscopy, for many years, it was a wonder but finally, the explanation was provided by the uncertainty principle. The average lifetime of an excited state is typically 10-8 sec. When an electron makes a downward jump from such state, it introduces an uncertainty in the exact time interval for de-excitation. Taking maximum uncertainty in the measurement of time to be the lifetime of the excited state, ∆E ≈ h 2π ⁄ ∆t . ∴∆ν = ∆E h ≈ 1 2π∆t ≈16 x 106Hz = 16 MHz. This is the theoretical line width of any spectral line emitted from a perfect monochromatic source. The important point is that it is non-zero.  Wave Mechanics Material particles follow laws of Newtonian mechanics. These laws and equations are based on classical concept of “perfect particles”. But at the beginning of 20th century, many experimentalists showed that material particles had effects which were typically regarded for many years as “wave properties” (for example, diffraction of electrons). There was no explanation to these newly demonstrated wave properties of matter in the framework of classical Newtonian mechanics. Hence, there was a need of mechanics, which could incorporate the wave nature of matter. This was developed independently by Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrödinger. Heisenberg’s formulation contains matrix algebra while that of Schrödinger’s is based on wave equations. Schrödinger’s approach is called as the wave mechanics. For this work, quantum mechanics introduced new physical properties and concepts. For example, the wave packet was introduced to explain wave nature shown by material particles and later it was supported by a foundation theory.

For example, all elementary particles like electrons and protons have been assigned an additional property called the spin and it is modelled that atoms possess magnetic moments due to intrinsic spins as well as orbital motion of electrons. Now, although we can’t see how an electron is, whether it actually “spins” and “revolves” and in what sense it interacts with a magnetic field, we can verify effect of the spin and orbital magnetic moments due to a collection of large number atoms in terms of magnetisation possessed by certain ferromagnetic materials.

Later of course, the concept of spin was supported by a foundation theory developed by Dirac based on relativistic quantum mechanics.  The Wave function  (x, t) A wave is said to be doubly periodic phenomenon meaning, in any kind of a wave, we can associate at least one physical quantity which is a periodic function of space (position) and time. For example, in electromagnetic waves, they are the electric and magnetic fields while in sound waves, it is the acoustic pressure that varies and gives rise to a compression or a rarefaction. In matter waves, this job has been assigned to the wave function. The only difference is that unlike electric/magnetic fields or pressure, which are real, physical quantities, the wave function is an abstract mathematical term and it can be a complex quantity to have a more general approach. However, the square of the wave function i.e. * or ||2 is called as the “probability” of finding the particle and this is a real number between 0 and 1 (or 0% and 100%). Thus, the matter waves or wave associated with material particles are somewhat related to the probabilistic outcome for any kind of measurement performed on the particle. Therefore, sometimes, matter waves are called as “waves of probability”.  Conditions on the wave function The wave function should satisfy following requirements: 1) It must be finite, single valued and continuous (and hence differentiable) everywhere. 2) Its derivatives ( ∂ ∂x , ∂ ∂t etc.) must also be finite, single valued and continuous. 3) It must be “normalised” meaning as x →±∞, (x, t) →0. 4) It must have at least one physically acceptable solution. 5) It must obey the principle of superposition of waves i.e. if 1 and 2 are solutions of the wave equation then A1 + B2 is also a solution.  Schrödinger’s time dependent wave equation (STDE) With the wave function being complex and representing periodicity in space and time, we can thick of the most general expression for the wave function as (x, t) = Aei(kx−ωt); Where, A is amplitude. Let us develop Schrödinger’s equation from this expression of wave function. Taking partial derivatives with respect of space (x) and time (t), ∂ ∂t = Aei(kx−ωt) × (− iω) = − iω= −i(2πν)= −i (2πE h ) = −iE ħ  ∴i ħ ∂ ∂t = E. (1) Similarly, ∂ ∂x = Aei(kx−ωt) × (ik) = ik= i (2π λ ) = i (2πp h ) = ip ħ ", "doc_name": "Prof. Surens Notes on Quantum Mechanics.pdf", "page": 12, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 3 Quantum Mechanics\\Prof. Surens Notes on Quantum Mechanics.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

(2) Equations (1) and (2) are called “eigenvalue equations”. From both the equations we can identify an operator which operates on the wave function  and yields a parameter (physical quantity) multiplied by  again. For example, in equation (1), the term “i ħ ∂ ∂t” is called the “energy operator” as it operates on the wave function to give total energy “E”. This can be expressed as Eop() = E. Similarly, let V(x) be a potential energy operator such that V(x)(x, t) = V. (3) Note that potential energy is considered as a function of only position, which is true for most of the dynamical systems in mechanics. (For example, the gravitational potential) As the second equation yields kinetic energy, we can couple equations (1), (2) and (3) to get a very familiar equation in mechanics that is T. E. = K. E. + P. E. Thus, i ħ ∂ ∂t = − ħ2 2m ∂2 ∂x2 + V(x)(x, t) (STDE) Equation above is known as Schrödinger’s time dependent wave equation. It is the central equation of wave mechanics just as the Newton’s second law is to classical mechanics.  Reduction to time-independent form (STIE) In many applications, it is sufficient to use the wave function which is the function of position alone. The applications include central force field problems (formation of the periodic table and all of chemistry!), harmonic oscillator (all types of SHM), potential well (traps such as electron in a quantum dot), potential barrier (tunnel effect), potential step (reflection and refraction), periodic potential (metals, semiconductors and insulators). The simplified version is obtained by using method of separation of variables. Let us express the wave function as (x, t) = φ(x). f(t) ∴ i ħφ(x) ∂f ∂t = −ħ2 2m f(t) ∂2φ ∂x2 + V(x)φ(x)f(t) Dividing everywhere by φ(x). f(t), i ħ 1 f ∂f ∂t = − ħ2 2m 1 φ ∂2φ ∂x2 + V(x). The LHS is a function of only time whereas the RHS is a function of only position. Equating both sides to a common separation constant say “s”, iħ 1 f ∂f ∂t = s. Integrating, f(t) = e−ist/ħ. Comparing this form with the time-factor part of the original expression of the wave function viz. e−iωt, we get 𝑠= ħω = hν = E. Thus the separation constant is nothing but the total energy “E”. Using this result for the RHS,", "doc_name": "Prof. Surens Notes on Quantum Mechanics.pdf", "page": 13, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 3 Quantum Mechanics\\Prof. Surens Notes on Quantum Mechanics.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

Multiplying everywhere by φ(x) and using complete derivative instead of partial since the reduced wave function φ(x) is a function of position alone, − ħ2 2m d2φ dx2 + V(x)φ(x) = Eφ(x) (STIE) Equation above is known as Schrödinger’s time independent wave equation. Many microscopic systems are studied by using this equation. In fact, the whole of periodic table with the electron configurations, shells, orbitals, stationary orbits, selection rules, l-s/j-j coupling, bonding-antibonding, the numbers n/l/ml/ms and the entire chemistry of elements is in fact, derived from solution of this Schrödinger’s equation in the electrostatic central force field problem having spherical symmetry.  Application to particle trapped in a 1-dimentional potential well (particle in a box problem) Here, we consider a classic example of a particle trapped in a one dimensional “potential well” of infinite height. It is of course, an idealistic example but it is the most simple and gives a quick start understanding of the solution of STIE. The potential function is described as follows: V(x) = 0; for 0 < x < L = ∞; for x ≤0, and x ≥L Following is a sketch of the same: The Schrödinger’s equation for region I can be written as − ħ2 2m d2φ dx2 = Eφ(x); As V = 0. ∴ d2φ dx2 = − 2mE ħ2 φ = −k2φ; Where, k = √2mE ħ = 2π λ The real part of the general solution of differential equation of the form d2φ dx2 + k2φ = 0 is φ(x) = A sin kx + B cos kx; Where, A and B are constant to be evaluated.", "doc_name": "Prof. Surens Notes on Quantum Mechanics.pdf", "page": 14, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 3 Quantum Mechanics\\Prof. Surens Notes on Quantum Mechanics.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}
{"text": "Prepared by: Dr. Suren Patwardhan Page 15 of 18 F Y B Tech 2021-22\\Engg. Physics For region I and II, φ(x) = 0 identically for all values of x as the particle cannot exist in region II. Using boundary conditions for region I viz. φ(x) = 0 at x = 0, we get B = 0 (as cos (0) = 1). This implies that “A” cannot be zero as the wave function must have at least one non-zero solution. This requirement comes from the fact that the wave function is related with the probability of finding the particle in region I and if it is zero for any value of x between 0 and L, it means the particle does not exist in region I. This would contradict the statement of the problem itself as the particle is confined to region I. Thus, φ(x) = A sinkx Using the second boundary condition φ(x) = 0 at x = L, 0 = A sin kL ⇒k = nπ L ; 𝑛= 1, 2, 3, … The value n = 0 is omitted as it would again mean that the wave function is zero for any value of x between 0 and L and thus, non-existence of particle in region I. This is absurd since the particle is constrained in region I with infinite boundaries. Thus, we get k or kn = nπ L . As k = √2mE ħ , we get En = n2π2ħ2 2mL2 = n2h2 8mL2 ; n = 1, 2, 3, … As n takes integer values, above equation implies an interesting result that energy possessed by the particle confined to a small region is “quantised” (En ∝n2) It can be seen that the momentum is also quantised since it is given by p = ±ħk = ± nh 2L. Most probable positions of the particle for different values of n within the potential well can be obtained by squaring the wave function given by φ(x) = A sin nπ L . Further, boundary conditions can be used to evaluate the constant A. It comes out to be √2 L so the probability factor is P(x) = φ(x)2 = 2 L sin2 nπ L Integrating it over 0 to L most probable positions of the particle for a given value of n can be obtained. In practice, we get finite potential well instead of the infinite well discussed above. But the calculations used here apply to a good extent to microscopic problems. Many modern electronic devices (e.g. MOSFETs, laser diodes and LEDs) use these calculations for deciding the design criteria and material selection for these devices.  Extension to 3-dimentional case Above treatment can readily be extended to 3-dimensions. We assume particle confined to a “potential box” with sides a, b and c. The corresponding wave function can be written as φ(x, y, z) = φ(x)φ(y)φ(z) = √8 abc sin nxπx a sin nyπy b sin nzπz c ; where nx, ny and nz are quantum numbers", "doc_name": "Prof. Surens Notes on Quantum Mechanics.pdf", "page": 15, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 3 Quantum Mechanics\\Prof. Surens Notes on Quantum Mechanics.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

Physics  Degeneracy As nx, ny, nz each can take integer value, it is obvious that different permutations of nx, ny, nz yield the same value of energy given by above equation. For example, all the wave functions given by (say) φ211 = √8 abc sin 2πx a sin πy b sin πz c , φ121 = √8 abc sin πx a sin 2πy b sin πz c , φ112 = √8 abc sin πx a sin πy b sin 2πz c will have the same energy eigenvalue. Thus, if different wave functions have the same energy eigenvalue, that energy state is said to be “degenerate”. The number of possible wave functions sharing the energy eigenvalue decide the degree of degeneracy. Here, e.g. the energy state has 3-fold degeneracy. Modern research in electronics and materials science (e.g. quantum dots, single electron transistors) use these concepts.  Quantum computing Richard Feynman, a Nobel Laureate once suggested that we could use quantum mechanical concepts for computer algorithms. Today, this field is called quantum computing. A “quantum computer” is that machine, which utilizes quantum mechanical effects such as the superposition or quantum entanglement to improve computational power.  Physics of information Today’s computers are essentially classical in a sense that the fundamental building block viz. the “bit” can be either “0” or “1” at a given time but never both (!) at the same time. In practice, it is realized by making tiny transistors in the IC “on” (saturated) or “off” (cut-off). No transistor can be both on and off at the same time! Imagine a computer which uses 2-bit “words” where the possible words are “00”, “01”, “10” and “11”. Today’s computer performs operation on these words one at a time but in a quantum computer, these words can exist at least in principle in a “superposed” state of all. An operation performed on this special state would virtually act on all the four words simultaneously and this is a direct advantage in terms of the time required to perform a computation. It has been demonstrated by Peter Shor (1994) that to factorise a number having 400 digits by using today’s computational methods would take time more than the age of known universe but by using quantum algorithm, it would merely take 3 years. Following graph depicts this advantage as worked out by IBM:", "doc_name": "Prof. Surens Notes on Quantum Mechanics.pdf", "page": 16, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 3 Quantum Mechanics\\Prof. Surens Notes on Quantum Mechanics.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

Physics In an another algorithm put forward by Grover (1996), it was shown that time to search a specific entry in a database consisting of “N” entries would take “√N ” trials by using quantum algorithm whereas it normally takes “N/2” trials by using today’s methods of database search. The advantage would be very clear for larger and larger values of N.  Qubit and Dirac Notaions A qubit is the basic unit in a quantum computer (the same way bit is to today’s classical computers). However, the qubit can be represented by a multiple ways e.g. ground state (0) and excited state (1) of an ion, electron/nucleon spin state up (1) or down (0), photon left polarized (1) or right polarized (0) etc. accordingly, there is a variety of hardware. In quantum mechanics, these base states are represented by vectors in a 2n dimentional space where n is the size of the computer word. The qubit with two possible states (0 and 1) is represented as: |ψ⟩= a|0⟩+ b|1⟩ A combination of such qubits in superposed state will also be in a superposed state. Under this advantage, an operation performed would work on all the possible outcomes simultaneously as shown in figure below. For example, in a three-qubit system, there are total 8 outcomes possible so a quantum algorithm works on all these 8 possible outcomes unlike a classical computer, which works on one outcome at a time. Here, the notation | ⟩ is called as “ket” vector and it is basically a column matrix. It is popularly called as Dirac’s notation. The output is probabilistic and the probability amplitude in this example will be a2 + b2 for a partcular output.  Quantum hardware There are a number of models proposed for realizing the potentials of quantum computing. The main objective is to hold the quantum superposition. Following are some of the models: 1. Quantum dot: a quantum dot consists of an electron trapped in a cage of atoms. Such electoren possesses discrete energy levels. The ground state and excited state of this electron are regarded as logic 0 and 1 while a laser source is used as a gate (control). 2. Ion trap: it uses some ions such as Ca. The Ca atom/ion in its ground state and metastable state is interpreted as logic 0 and 1 respectively. 3. NMR: in this, qubits are represented by nuclear spin states using nuclei of certain elements. A magnetic field is used as gate.", "doc_name": "Prof. Surens Notes on Quantum Mechanics.pdf", "page": 17, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 3 Quantum Mechanics\\Prof. Surens Notes on Quantum Mechanics.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

The advantages are clear when the data sizes are huge. The major sectors which have been considered include cryptography, big data analysis, astronomical computations, weather models, finance and e-commerce. The main challenge in developing a quantum computer is “decoherence”. In simple words, decoherence is the loss of state of superposition (quantum entanglement) of qubits. Such a state can be lost due to a measurement performed on the system. Another problem is to interpret the probabilistic outcome of any measurement. Here, the main challenge is to develop suitable error correcting codes for the output. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------", "doc_name": "Prof. Surens Notes on Quantum Mechanics.pdf", "page": 18, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 3 Quantum Mechanics\\Prof. Surens Notes on Quantum Mechanics.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

The temporal period ’τ’ is the number of units of time per wave and inverse of it (τ) is temporal frequency ν, or the number of waves per unit of time. Thus, ν = 1/τ.

Because v < c always, hence the matter wave always travels faster than light. 5 Concept of Wave packet The velocity of de-Broglie wave is given by vp = c2/v, but no material particle can have velocity greater than c, also if velocity of de-Broglie wave is greater than the velocity of the particle then the particle will left behind. Hence, it has been concluded that instead of one wave, a wave packet is associated with particle. The wave packet is formed by superposition of several waves whose velocities and wavelengths are slightly diﬀerent from each other. The amplitude and phase of the component waves are such that they interfere constructively in a region where the particle is found and outside the region they interfere destructively. Thus, when several progressive waves of slightly diﬀerent wavelengths travel along in one direction, the resultant wave obtained on superposition travel in form of group of waves which is called wave packet. The velocity of component waves of a wave packet is called the wave velocity or phase velocity vp and the velocity of wave packet is called the group velocity vg. Figure 4: Formation of wave packet.

Thus the wave velocity of the matter wave is less than the particle velocity, hence the matter wave will be left behind, which is wrong because there will be no relationship between the particle and the matter wave.

Now let consider this wave packet is formed due to superposition of two sinusoidal waves of diﬀerent angular frequencies ω1 & ω2 and propagation constant k1 & k2 traveling along X-axis. The equations are, ψ1 = A sin (ω1t −k1x) ψ2 = A sin (ω2t −k2x) Using superpostion principle, ψ = ψ1 + ψ2 = A sin (ω1t −k1x) + A sin (ω2t −k2x) = 2A cos \u0012δω 2 t −δk 2 x \u0013 sin (ωt −kx) , where, ω = ω1 + ω2 2 , k = k1 + k2 2 , δω = ω1 −ω2, and δk = k1 −k2. The error in the measurement of the position of the particle is equal to the distance be- tween two nodes. These nodes are formed when cos \u0012δω 2 t −δk 2 x \u0013 = 0, i.e., \u0012δω 2 t −δk 2 x \u0013 = π 2 , 3π 2 , 5π 2 , · · · . Let x1 and x2 are the position of any two successive nodes at any time t, then δω 2 t −δk 2 x1 = (2n + 1)π 2 and δω 2 t −δk 2 x2 = (2n + 3)π 2 on substraction, =⇒ δk 2 (x2 −x1) = π =⇒ ∆x = x2 −x1 = 2π δk =⇒ ∆x = 2π δk = 2π ∆ \u0000 2π λ \u0001 = 1 ∆ \u0000 p h \u0001 = 1 ∆p =⇒ ∆x.∆p = h =⇒ ∆x.∆p ≥ℏ \u0012 = h 2π \u0013 17", "doc_name": "WM - 4BTech_removed.pdf", "page": 8, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 3 Quantum Mechanics\\WM - 4BTech_removed.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}
{"text": "=⇒ ∆x.∆p ≥ℏ 7.1 Energy and time uncertainty principle We know that group velocity vg is equal to particle velocity vx. Let the wave packet moves ∆x distance in ∆t time. Since ∆x is the uncertainty in the x-coordinate and ∆t is the uncertainty in time, hence vg = ∆x ∆t =⇒ ∆t = ∆x vg . (11) As energy E ≡E(px) ∆E = ∂E ∂px .∆px. But ∂E ∂px = vx = vg [∵E = 1 2mv2 −→ ∂E ∂v = 1 22mv −→ ∂E ∂p = v.] ∴ ∆E = vg.∆px (12) Using Eqs (11) and (12), ∆E.∆t = vg.∆px.∆x vg = ∆px.∆x ≥ℏ [Using Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle] =⇒ ∆E.∆t = ℏ 7.2 Applications of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle 7.2.1 Non-exitance of electron in nucleus Since size of nucleus = 10−14m, hence uncertainty in position inside the nucleus = 2 × 10−14m. From Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, ∆px = ℏ ∆x = 1.055 × 10−14J −sec 2 × 10−14 m = 5.275 × 10−21Kg −m/s. Since the magnitude of momentum is relativistic compare to the mass of the electron, then using relativistic mass formula for energy of electron, E2 = p2c2 + m2 0c4 E2 = p2c2 [∵ m2 0c4 = 0.511MeV ≪p2c2] E = pc = (5.275 × 10−21) × (3 × 108)J 18", "doc_name": "WM - 4BTech_removed.pdf", "page": 9, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 3 Quantum Mechanics\\WM - 4BTech_removed.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}
{"text": "= (5.275 × 10−21) × (3 × 108) 1.6 × 10−19 eV = 10Mev. Thus if the electron resides in the nucleus, it should have an energy of the order of 10MeV . However, electrons emitted during β-decay have energies of the order of 3MeV . Hence we conclude that electron do not reside in the nucleus. 8 The wave function ‘Ψ’ The wave function describes the wave properties of the moving particle. It is denoted by ‘Ψ’and is complex in nature, i.e., Ψ = a + ib, where a and b are real numbers. 8.1 Properties or physical signiﬁcance of wave function 1. Ψ must be continues and single values everywhere. 2. ∂Ψ ∂x , ∂Ψ ∂y , ∂Ψ ∂z also must be continues and single values everywhere. 3. Ψ must be normalized, i.e., Ψ = 0 as x →±∞, y →±∞, z →±∞, i.e., ∞ Z −∞ |Ψ|2dV = 1. 4. |Ψ|2 = ΨΨ∗deﬁnes probability density and is at any particular place and time is proportional to the probability of ﬁnding the particle at that place on that time.

This equation has same signiﬁcance in quantum mechanics as Newton’s laws of motion has in classical mechanics. 9.1 Time independent Schr¨odinger wave equation Consider a system of stationary particle associated with the particle. Let Ψ(r, t) be the wave function for the de-Broglie wave at any location ⃗r = i x + j y + k z at time t. Then 3D wave equation can be written as, ∇2Ψ = 1 u2 ∂2Ψ ∂t2 or ∂2Ψ ∂x2 + ∂2Ψ ∂y2 + ∂2Ψ ∂z2 = 1 u2 ∂2Ψ ∂t2 , (13) where u−> wave velocity. The solution of Eqn (13) can be written as, Ψ (r, t) = Ψ0(r) e−i ωt (14) where Ψ0 is the amplitude of wave at the point considered. Diﬀerentiating Eqn (14) twice w.r.t. t, ∂Ψ ∂t = −i ωΨ0(r) e−i ωt, ∂2Ψ ∂t2 = (−i ω)2 Ψ0(r) e−i ωt = −ω2 Ψ0(r) e−i ωt, = −ω2 Ψ(r, t) (15) Substituting (15) into (13), ∇2Ψ = −ω2 u2 Ψ, ∵ω = 2πν = 2πu λ (∵u = νλ) 20", "doc_name": "WM - 4BTech_removed.pdf", "page": 11, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 3 Quantum Mechanics\\WM - 4BTech_removed.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

Physics Module 2 Unit 1 SEMICONDUCTORS – NOTES (MAIN) (As per SVU-R2020 Scheme & Syllabus)  Introduction Solids are classified into three distinct categories based on their electrical properties. They are conductors, insulators and semiconductors. The range of conductivity is quite large. For metals such as copper and silver, it is about 10+ 8 S/m while that for insulator such as glass, it is about 10–11 S/m. It is convenient to consider another intermediate class of materials having moderate conductivity, which are known as semiconductors. A typical semiconductor such as silicon (pure) has conductivity of 10– 3 S/m. Thanks to the development of material engineering and semiconductor technology, it is possible to fabricate a wide variety of electronic devices from the same semiconductor wafer (chip). This is the main reason for semiconductors being so much important. All sorts of gadgets made from semiconductor devices are so much integrated with our daily needs that any branch of science and engineering cannot bypass the basic knowledge of semiconductor physics in their curriculum. In different solids, the energy bands may be overlapping each other or they may remain separated by small or large gaps. The overlapping or separation between valence band and conduction band is of particular importance as it ultimately decides the electrical, thermal and optical properties of materials. The classification of solids based on energy bands is shown in figure below.  E-k diagrams For solids, plot of the variation of total energy of electrons (E) with their wave vector (denoted by k⃗ and related to its momentum) is know as E-k diagram.

Physics the condution band (CB) and the highest of the valence band (VB) (shaded area in the E-k diagram), it can be approximated as parabolic. Energy of electrons in CB is given by E = EC + ħ2k2 2m∗ while energy of electrons in VB is given by E = EV −ħ2k2 2m∗ where, m* is called effective mass of electron and ħ = h 2π is called reduced Planck's constant. Typical E-k diagram for a semiconductor is shown in following figure. Usually, the range of k⃗ -values is very large and most of the electrons (and holes) at room temeprature and at moderate biasing happen to be near to CB minima (and VB maxima). Thus, the E-k diagram is simplified by plotting it only at the CB minima and VB maxima position for all electrons and holes in the solid. This simplified energy band diagram is enenrgy v/s position (x) of electrons and holes in the semiconductors. This is sufficient for most of the device physics analysis.  Direct and Indirect bandgap semiconductors:", "doc_name": "Notes on Semiconductors by Dr. Suren Patwardhan.pdf", "page": 2, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 4 Semiconductors and Electromagnetism\\Semiconductors\\Notes on Semiconductors by Dr. Suren Patwardhan.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}
{"text": "Prepared by: Prof Suren Patwardhan Page 3 of 15 F Y B Tech 2020-21\\Engg. Physics E-k diagrams for different solids significantly differ from each other. But, a broad classification of solids can be made based on the position of CB minima (CBM) and VB maxima (VBM). In some semiconductors, the CBM and VBM occur at the same value of k. These solids are called “direct bandgap semiconductors”. Examples of direct bandgap secimonductors are GaAs and InP. In some solids, CBM and VBM occur at different values of k. Such semiconductors are called inderect bandgap semiconductors. Examples of indirect bandgap semiconductors are Si and Ge. light emitting devices such as LEDs or laser diodes are always made from direct bandgap materials like GaAs whereas Si cannot make an efficient light emitting device although Si (and Ge) are very much useful as light absorbing device i.e. photodiodes.  Concept of effective mass: Electrons, in a strict sense, are governed by laws of quantum mechanics and the ordinary laws of motion in classical mechanics cannot be directly used for describing dynamics of electrons. In quantum mechanics, eletrons (and for matter, all material objects) are better described by the concept of wave-particle duality in order to account for wave phenomena exhibited by electrons (and all material particles). According to quantum mechanics, the “electron wave” spreads over the solid and it is influenced by the lattie. It is possible to simplify this motion by letting the net interaction of an electron with the lattie into an “internal” force F⃗ int. The total force acting on an electron can be written as F⃗ = F⃗ ext + F⃗ int. The wave nature associated with an electron can thus be “absorbed” in this internal force and we can still treat electrons as perfect particles and continue using laws of mechanics i.e. Newton’s second law F⃗ = dp⃗ dt and energy-momentum relation E = p2 2m provide, we make following (fundamental) shifts in the interpretation of physical quatities to incoprporate the wave nature of particles: 1) m →m∗, Where m∗ is effective mass 2) p⃗ →ħk⃗ , Where k⃗ is wave vector k⃗ is also called as “crysal momentum” The first equation comes due to the fact that motion of electrons in solids are influenced by crystal lattice The second substitution follwos from the de’Broglie equation for matter waves: p = h λ = h 2π × 2π λ = ħk as E = EC + ħ2k2 2m∗ OR E = EV − ħ2k2 2m∗", "doc_name": "Notes on Semiconductors by Dr. Suren Patwardhan.pdf", "page": 3, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 4 Semiconductors and Electromagnetism\\Semiconductors\\Notes on Semiconductors by Dr. Suren Patwardhan.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

Physics d2E dk2 = ħ2 m∗  m∗= ħ2 (d2E dk2) Normally, if we calculate the ratio of applied force to the acceleration produced then it should yield mass of the particle. But in solids, motion of any charged particle like an electron or a hole is influenced by a large number of factors such as lattice sites (atoms or ions), defects and impurities or the other electrons and holes and therefore, the ratio of force to acceleration comes out to be different from its mass if it were isolated and outside the solid. This enables the introduction of effective mass concept. Effective mass is a parameter that depends upon the material, its structure, lattice periodicity, lattice directions, interaction energy and various other factors. The effective mass calculations are complicated and they differ from solid to solid. For calculation purposes, the effective mass is given as some factor of the actual mass of particle e.g. 0.67me; where me is the actual mass of an electron. Effective masses of both the charge carriers viz. electrons and holes in semiconductors are expressed in above manner.  Concept of hole as positive charge carrier: Curvature of E-k diagram gives estimation of effective mass. In particular, at the V. B. maxima, the second derivative is negative, which implies an electron with negative effective mass. The motion of an electron at the top of VB with negative charge and negative mass is along the electric field i.e. it is anologous to a positive charge carrier with usual mass. Hence, it is convenient to itroduce the concept of a hole as a positive charge carrier taking part in electrical conduction moving along the electric field.", "doc_name": "Notes on Semiconductors by Dr. Suren Patwardhan.pdf", "page": 4, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 4 Semiconductors and Electromagnetism\\Semiconductors\\Notes on Semiconductors by Dr. Suren Patwardhan.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}
{"text": "Prepared by: Prof Suren Patwardhan Page 5 of 15 F Y B Tech 2020-21\\Engg. Physics By definition, a hole is an electron missing from the VB of the host atom. When an electron from a host atoms shifts to some other site, it leaves behind uncompensated host atom with a net positive charge. This site in the VB of host atom with a deficit of one electron is regarded as hole. In the next instance, electron from some other host atom would jump to this site leaving behind uncompensated host at that place with a net positive charge. This is described as movement of the hole from one place to the other. Instead of considering movements of a number of electrons from one site to the other, it is easier to trace the motion of a hole carrying positive charge in backwards direction. Under the action of external electric field, such shifts of valence electrons occur in specific direction giving an apparent shift of holes along the electric field as shown in above figure.  Semiconductor statistics The first important parameter in the study of semiconductors is to know how many electrons are available in the CB or how many vacancies i.e. holes are available in the VB. This is calculated by using two functions: 1) The Fermi-Dirac distribution function F(E), which gives the probability of occupation of an energy level by electron and 2) The density of states function N(E), which gives the number of energy states possible or available per unit volume per electron-volt. Since the number of electrons or holes involved is very high, statistical calculations become useful. The number of electrons or holes is obtained by integrating the product of above functions over the desired energy range.  The Fermi-Dirac function This statistical function is applicable to all particles having half integral spin (spin ½ particles), which are called as “fermions”. An electron is a chief example of fermionic particle. The main feature of any fermion is that it obeys the Pauli’s exclusion principle, which states that “no two electrons can have the same energy level in an interacting system.” The Fermi-Dirac function is a function of energy and temperature. It is given by, F(E) = 1 1+e (E−EF) kT ⁄ ; Where, E is energy, k is Boltzmann constant and T is absolute temperature. The energy level EF is called the Fermi level. It is used as a reference energy level to evaluate energies of electrons and holes and also to indicate the majority and minority carrier concentrations. The Fermi energy level is an important concept in the study of any kind of solid. More discussion o Fermi level and Fermi-Dirac function is done in further sections.  Density of states function This function is related to the degrees of freedom of electrons within any solid. It indicates the allowed energies per eV per unit volume of the solid. It is given by, N(E)dE = 4π (2m∗ h2 ) 3/2 √E dE", "doc_name": "Notes on Semiconductors by Dr. Suren Patwardhan.pdf", "page": 5, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 4 Semiconductors and Electromagnetism\\Semiconductors\\Notes on Semiconductors by Dr. Suren Patwardhan.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

Physics  Application of Fermi-Dirac function to derive Semiconductor transport equations 1) Number of electrons and holes for conduction of electricity and heat: The number of electrons in the CB is obtained by integrating the product F(E)N(E). Lowest energy possessed by a conduction electron is EC and highest energy is taken to be infinity for mathematical simplicity. Thus, n = ∫ F(E)N(E)dE  EC = ∫ 1 1+exp(E−EF kT ) 4π ( 2m∗ h2 ) 3/2 √E dE  EC The above integral evaluates to n = NCexp (− EC−EF kT ); where NC is called density of states in the CB. It is a temperature and material dependent parameter. Since a hole is nothing but deficiency of electron or electron missing from the VB, the probability factor for finding hole in the VB is taken as 1 – F(E). Highest energy possessed by a hole in the VB is EV and lowest energy is taken to be negative infinity for mathematical simplicity. Thus, p = ∫ [1 −F(E)]N(E)dE EV −∞ = ∫ [1 − 1 1+exp(E−EF kT )] 4π ( 2m∗ h2 ) 3/2 √E dE EV − It evaluates to p = NVexp (− EF−EV kT ); where NV is called density of states in the VB which is also a temperature and material dependent parameter. The values of NC and NV are close to each other for most of the semiconductors. 2) Intrinsic concentration: The number of free electrons or number of holes in the VB per unit volume is called as intrinsic carrier concentration. Since number of free electrons and holes is same for an intrinsic material, we write n = p = say ni ∴ni 2 = n. p = NCexp (−EC −EF kT ) . NVexp (−EF −EV kT ) ∴ni 2 = NCNVexp (−EC −EV kT ) The difference EC – EV is called the “energy band gap” denoted by “Eg”. Thus, ∴ni = (√NCNV)exp (− Eg 2kT) 3) Charge neutrality condition: In any semiconductor, the sum of all kinds of charges is zero which is written as: n + ND + = p + NA − This is called charge neutrality condition. 4) Mass-action law: At thermal equilibrium, the product “n x p” is constant and it holds for any material, whether intrinsic or extrinsic. This is called the mass-action law. In mathematical form it is written as np = ni 2 = constant at equilibrium condition. Equilibrium referes to state of", "doc_name": "Notes on Semiconductors by Dr. Suren Patwardhan.pdf", "page": 6, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 4 Semiconductors and Electromagnetism\\Semiconductors\\Notes on Semiconductors by Dr. Suren Patwardhan.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

Excess charge carriers are generated when equilibrium is disturbed. 5) Extrinsic concentration: In extrinsic materials, there is an additional source for one type of impurity; electrons in n-type and holes in p-type. Accordingly they are called as majority carriers. On the contrary, holes in n-type and electrons in p-type material are very small in number and they are called as minority carriers. In n-type material at RT, most of the electrons from donors are available free and since each donor contributes one electron number of majority carriers (i.e. electrons) is the same as number of donors added. Number of minority carriers is obtained by using mass action law given above. Thus,  For n-type material at RT: Majority carrier concentration nn ≈ND, Minority carrier concentration pn ≈ ni 2 ND. ND is number of donors per unit volume.  For p-type material at RT: Majority carrier concentration pp ≈NA, Minority carrier concentration np ≈ ni 2 NA. NA is number of acceptors per unit volume. 6) Conductivity and resistivity: The conductivity of semiconductor is proportional to the total number of charge carriers i.e. number of electrons plus number of holes. With increasing temperature, more and more charge carriers become free for conduction and conductivity of semiconductors increases with increasing temperature. Hence, semiconductors have negative temperature coefficient of resistance. For intrinsic material, both types of charge carriers contribute evenly while for extrinsic materials, one type of charge carrier dominates and contribution of the other can be neglected. Thus,  For n-type: σ = qnμn; where μn is called “mobility of electrons”.  For p-type: σ = qpμp; where μp is called “mobility of holes”. Mobility is defined in further seciton.  For intrinsic: σ = qni(μn + μp) SI unit of conductivity is siemens/m (S/m). Resistivity is the reciprocal of conductivity. Thus, ρ = 1 σ. SI unit of resistivity is -m. 7) Temperature dependence of conductivity of extrinsic semiconductors: The contribution to conductivity of an extrinsic semiconductor comes from different mechanisms at different temepratures. i) At very low temperatures (< 10 K), all the electrons occupy lowest enenrgy states. VB is full and CB is empty. This is called “freeze-out” regime and the semiconductors behaves as an insuator. ii) At low temperatures (10-100 K), electrons and holes from donors and acceptors are liberated due to increased thermal energy. CB gets filled up and VB starts acquiring holes. This is called “ionization” regime and the semiconductor starts conducting.", "doc_name": "Notes on Semiconductors by Dr. Suren Patwardhan.pdf", "page": 7, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 4 Semiconductors and Electromagnetism\\Semiconductors\\Notes on Semiconductors by Dr. Suren Patwardhan.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

This is called “extrinsic” regime and the conductivity attains plateau till a certain temperature called the “intrinsic temperature” (Ti). v) For temperaures beyond Ti, there is no further contribution from donors or acceptors as they are already been depleted. However, due to high temperatures, breaking bonds of host atoms becomes signifiant and the intrinsic charge carriers start controlling the conductivity. This is called “intrinsic” regime and the semiconductor behaves as if it is undoped. The conductivity in this regime rises exponentially with temperature. 8) Carrier drift and drift velocity: Motion of a charged particle under the influence of electric or magnetic field is called “drift”. If we apply an electric field across a semiconductor, its charge carriers viz. electrons and holes do not move in straight lines towards the field. Since the solid is packed by atoms, the charge carriers are continuously deviated from their paths and they end up in a random walk. In the absence of the external field, the net path covered is zero but under the influence of electric field, there is a definite shift towards the electric field (in case of a positive charge) as shown in the diagram: Although the actual path covered by the particle is large, the effective path covered along the direction of electric field is small. The ratio of effective path covered to the total time taken is called as “drift velocity” of the charge carriers. 9) Mobility: The drift velocity is linearly proportional to the electric field intensity (until drift velocity gets saturated at certain critical field intensity). Thus, vd ∝ℇ ⇒vd = μℇ; Where the symbol “ℇ” is used for electric field intensity. The constant of proportionality is called “mobility” of charge carriers. It indicates how fluently a charge carrier can sweep through the electric field. It can be defined as the drift velocity acquired per unit electric field intensity.

The drift current density is given by J drift = qnv⃗ d.

Here, “n” is electron density i.e. number of electrons per unit volume. ∴Jdrift(eletrons) = qnvd numericaly For holes, J drift(holes) = (+q) × p × (+v⃗ d) = qpv⃗ d … as holes are positively charged and they drift along the electric field.

In one dimension, the concentration gradient is nothing but spatial variation of number of particles per unit volume. Due to the concentration gradient, a particle flux is generated in the direction of decreasing concentration gradient. This particle flux is called as “diffusion current density”. For electrons and holes, we have J diffusion ∝− dn dx î. Symbol “n” here is the particle density as before and here it referes to any particle in general (electron or hole). Negative sign is taken because the current flows in the direction of decreasing concentration gradient. For electrons, J diffusion(eletrons) = (−q) × Dn × (−dn dx) î ∴Jdiffusion(eletrons) = qDn dn dx numerically. Here dn dx is the conentration gradient for electrons. The constant of proportionality is called diffusion coefficient (Dn) of electrons. Its SI unit is m2/s. For holes, J diffusion(holes) = (+q) × Dp × (−dp dx) î ∴Jdiffusion(holes) = −qDn dp dx numerically. Here dp dx is the conentration gradient for holes and Dp is diffusion coefficient for holes. Thus,  For n-type: Jn = qDn dn dx  For p-type: Jn = −qDp dp dx  For intrinsic: J = q (Dn dn dx −Dp dp dx) 13) Einstein’s relations: Einstein’s work in statistical mechanics yields an important relation: The ratio of diffusion coefficient to mobility of any type of charge carrier at a given temperature is constant and it is expressed as: Dn μn = Dp μp = kT q = constant at a given temperature", "doc_name": "Notes on Semiconductors by Dr. Suren Patwardhan.pdf", "page": 11, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 4 Semiconductors and Electromagnetism\\Semiconductors\\Notes on Semiconductors by Dr. Suren Patwardhan.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

Physics 14) Total current density: In any semiconductor or a p-n junction device, there are four currents flowing across the junction: the drift currents and diffusion currents due to electrons and holes. Electron diffusion and hole drift is directed from p-side to n-side while hole diffusion and electron drift is directed from n-side to p-side. Their summation gives the total current density as follows: Jtotal = qDn dn dx + qpμpℇ−qDp dp dx + qnμnℇ ∴Jtotal = q [(Dn dn dx −Dp dp dx) + (nμn + pμp)ℇ]  The Fermi level For metals and non-metals, the Fermi level can be defined in some different ways. For metals,it is convinient to define it as: Definition 1 of Fermi level: The Fermi level is the highest available energy level at absolute zero temperature. It may or may not be actually occupied by an electron. For semiconductors, it is useful to define the Fermi level in different way as: Definition 2 of Fermi level: The Fermi level is that energy level for which, the probability of occupation is 50% at all temperatures except absolute zero temperature. The concept of Fermi energy level is very useful in all of solid state physics. For semiconductors in particular, the Fermi level position depends upon whether the semiconductor is pure or doped with n or p type impurities. For pure or intrinsic semiconductors, since number of electrons and holes are equal, the Fermi level is located between EC and EV i.e. at the centre of the forbidden energy region. For n-type material, it is closer to the CB since electrons are excess in number. In p-type material, it is closer to the VB since holes are excess in number. The energy band diagrams for n and p-type material show additional energy levels called donor level ED and acceptor level EA in n-type and p-type material respectively.  For intrinsic material, the Fermi level is located midway between the CB and VB For intrinsic materials we have, n = p ∴NCexp (− EC−EF kT ) = NVexp (− EF−EV kT ) ∴exp (− EC−EF kT ) . exp (+ EF−EV kT ) = NV NC ∴exp ( −EC+2EF−EV kT ) = NV NC", "doc_name": "Notes on Semiconductors by Dr. Suren Patwardhan.pdf", "page": 12, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 4 Semiconductors and Electromagnetism\\Semiconductors\\Notes on Semiconductors by Dr. Suren Patwardhan.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

Physics Taking logarithm on both sides, −EC+2EF−EV kT = ln ( NV NC) ∴EF = EC+EV 2 + kT 2 ln ( NV NC) For semiconductors, the values of NC and NV are close to each other. (For example in silicon at RT, NC = 3.2 x 1025/m3 and NV = 1.8 x 1025/m3). Further, value of kT  0.026 eV at RT hence the second term on RHS becomes negligible as compared to the band gap. (For Si, it is 1.1 eV at RT). So, neglecting the second term on RHS we get EF = EC+EV 2 (intrinsic semiconductors) Thus, Fermi level is located midway between the CB and VB.  Effect of impurity concentration on Fermi level As impurities are added to a semiconductor, electrical conduction is dominated by one type of charge i.e. electrons in n-type and holes in p-type. The Fermi level is an indicator of majority carriers. Hence, as impurities are added, the Fermi level shifts from its central position. In either material, the shift of Fermi level from the central position is directly proportional to the logarithm of donor or acceptor concentration. it is given by,  For n-type: EF −Ei = kTln( n ni) ; n ≈ND at RT  For p-type: EF −Ei = −kTln( p ni) ; p ≈NA at RT Ei is called the “intrinsic level” or the midway position.

{"text": "Prepared by: Prof Suren Patwardhan Page 14 of 15 F Y B Tech 2020-21\\Engg. Physics For very high doping concentrations i.e. when the doping density exceed effective densities of states, the Fermi level penetrates into the CB and VB in n-type and p-type semiconductors respectively. Such semiconductors are called “degenerate” semiconductors. Degenerate semiconductors are rrequired for certain applications such as zener diodes, laser diodes, microwave devices etc.  Effect of temperature on Fermi level The density of electrons or holes is a strong function of temperature and along with the density, there is a shift in the Fermi level also. Temperatuer dependance of conductivity is discussed earlier. Its reflection on the Fermi level is shown in figure above. At low temperatures in extrinsic semiconductors, the Fermi level is close to CB or VB in n or p type semiconductor respectively. As temperature increases, it deviates away from these positions. At the intrinsic temperature, Fermi level approaches centre of the bandgap and stays there for further increase in temperature. For intrinsic semiconductors, the Fermi level stays at the centre at all temperatures. With increasing temperatres, the energy bandgap of semiconductor also slowly decreases as shown in the diagram.  Temperature dependence of Fermi-Dirac function The Fermi Dirac function is given by, F(E) = 1 1 + exp (E −EF kT ) At all temperature except absolute zero, for E = EF, we get F(E) = 1 1+exp(E−EF kT ) = 1 1+e0 = 0.5 or 50%.

Both parts together imply that at absolute zero temperature, the probability that an electron can be present in the CB is zero and getting in the VB is 100%. It means the CB is empty and VB is full so no vacancies or holes. Since neither electrons nor holes are available for conduction, the semiconductor would behave as an insulator at absolute zero.

{"text": "Prepared by: Prof Suren Patwardhan Page 1 of 6 F Y B Tech 2020-21\\Engg. Physics Module 2 Unit 1 SEMICONDUCTORS – NOTES (SUPPLEMENTAL) (As per SVU-R2020 Scheme & Syllabus)  Formation of energy bands in solids The energy levels of electrons bound to the nucleus in any atom are essentially discrete, which follows from atomic theory. The typical energy configuration for any element say for example, silicon (Z = 14) is given by, 1s2, 2s2, 2p6, 3s2, 3p2. We consider two such Si atoms far away i.e. isolated from each other to start with. Now, let the two atoms come close to each other so that they interact meaning an electron from one atom is influenced by the electrostatic potential of the nucleus of other atom also. Then, the two Si atoms are no longer isolated and they form a single system. In such an interacting system, now there cannot be two electrons (one from each of the Si atoms) having the same energy as per Pauli’s exclusion principle. The bond formation between two atoms leads to splitting of the energy levels. In case of Si, 3s and 3p level split first and initially form a hybrid state (SP3 hybridization), which splits further at the distance equal to the bond length. In general, a solid may be considered as an assembly of a large number of atoms (say N) closely packed with each other. In such an interacting system, each energy level (particularly, the outer energy levels) splits N-fold giving a band of closely spaced energies as shown in figure above. The formation of energy bands is different in each solid and it is highly complicated. In different solids, the energy bands may be overlapping each other or they may remain separated by small or large gaps. The overlapping or separation between valence band and conduction band is of particular importance as it ultimately decides the electrical, thermal and optical properties of materials. The classification of solids based on energy bands is shown in figure below.", "doc_name": "Supplementary notes on Semiconductors by Dr. Suren Patwardhan.pdf", "page": 1, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 4 Semiconductors and Electromagnetism\\Semiconductors\\Supplementary notes on Semiconductors by Dr. Suren Patwardhan.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}
{"text": "Prepared by: Prof Suren Patwardhan Page 2 of 6 F Y B Tech 2020-21\\Engg. Physics Solids having partially overlapping conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) or very small gap in- between are termed conductors. Solids having small energy gap typically between 1 to 3 eV are termed as semiconductors while Solids having large energy gap typically greater than 5 eV are termed as isolators. The dependence of electrical conductivity on this energy band gap is exponential. To give you a feel of it, it may require only a few nano to microvolt to get a few milliampere current from metals. For getting the same current, it would require a few volts for a semiconductor while even by applying few thousands of volts, insulators may not still allow the current to flow.  Doping, intrinsic and extrinsic semiconductors Doping: A carefully engineered process of adding specific amount of foreign atoms into host semiconductor. Usual range of doping in Si for most of the applications is 1015 to 1019/cm3. Typical methods used for doping are high temperature (800-900°C) diffusion using vapours of dopants or ion implantation at room temperature using bombardment of dopant ions of a few keV energy. Intrinsic semiconductor: Semiconducting element in which, the electrical conduction is possible only by breaking covalent bonds between host atoms is called as intrinsic semiconductor. With each bond broken, we get an electron-hole pair for electrical conduction. Extrinsic semiconductor: Semiconducting elements in which, electrical conduction is carried predominantly by electrons or holes obtained from donor or acceptor impurities are called as extrinsic semiconductors. The number of electrons or holes obtained is large as compared to number of electron-hole pairs obtained by breaking bonds. Charge carriers in intrinsic semiconductor: Following diagram shows typical bonding structure of silicon; a prototype semiconductor. A particular electron “A” is a part of one of the covalent bonds. The same is indicated in an equivalent energy band diagram. It takes 1.1 eV of energy (at RT) to break a covalent bond in Si. When we do that, electron A becomes free and a vacancy bearing positive charge is created due to incomplete bond. This is regarded as “hole”.", "doc_name": "Supplementary notes on Semiconductors by Dr. Suren Patwardhan.pdf", "page": 2, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 4 Semiconductors and Electromagnetism\\Semiconductors\\Supplementary notes on Semiconductors by Dr. Suren Patwardhan.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

It takes very small amount of energy (merely 0.05 eV) to remove the fifth electron from the impurity. Electron-holes pairs are still created by breaking bonds between silicon atoms but now their proportion is very low (at RT).

Physics The addition of impurity is shown by indicating a “donor” level just below the CB in the energy band diagram Charge carriers in extrinsic p-type semiconductors: When we dope a pure semiconductor such as silicon with trivalent impurity such as boron, only three silicon atoms around it can form bonds with it and the forth bond is incomplete. But this is not a hole. When an electron shared by a neighbouring pair of silicon atoms jumps to boron to complete the forth covalent bond between boron and silicon, it leaves behind “uncompensated” silicon atom with deficit of one electron from its valence level. This is regarded as hole. Since the silicon atom is uncompensated, it acquires a net positive charge, which is assigned to the hole. In semiconductors at RT, such processes occur at all times and it can be called as “bond exchange”. Although it appears like breaking the bond between two host atoms, it doesn’t take full 1.1 eV of energy but it happens at merely 0.05 eV of energy.

The addition of impurity is shown by indicating a “acceptor” level just above the VB in the energy band diagram  Direct and Indirect bandgap semiconductors: In direct bandgap semiconductors, when an electron makes a transition from CB to VB or vice versa, its momentum is readily conserved since there is no change in k value (k is related with momentum). In indirect bandgap semiconductors, however, large change in k value is required for electron to make transition between bands. Here, a third particle called “phonon” is required for conservation of momentum. Phonons are quanta of lattice vibrations (the same way photons are quanta of light). Phonons possess small enenrgy but large momentum. In particular, during transition of electrons from CB to VB, energy is released in the form of emission of a photon of energy equal to the difference between CBM and VBM. For direct bandgap semiconductors, this process takes place efficiently (with quantum efficiency > 80%) whereas for indirect bandgap semiconductors, the", "doc_name": "Supplementary notes on Semiconductors by Dr. Suren Patwardhan.pdf", "page": 5, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 4 Semiconductors and Electromagnetism\\Semiconductors\\Supplementary notes on Semiconductors by Dr. Suren Patwardhan.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}
{"text": "Prepared by: Prof Suren Patwardhan Page 6 of 6 F Y B Tech 2020-21\\Engg. Physics efficiency is poor (< 10%) due to the requirement of phonons. For this reason, light emitting devices such as LEDs are always made from direct bandgap materials like GaAs whereas Si cannot make an efficient LED or laser diode. Abobe problem is not very critical during upward transition i.e. absorption. Electrons in the VB of indirect bandgap materials can absorb higher energy photons to transfer into CB without much change in the momentum (k value). Hence, although Si and Ge cannot be used for making sources of light (LEDs), they are very much useful as detectors of light (photodiodes). Continuity equation: One of the most important equations of semiconductor physics is the continuity equation. It states that “when equilibrium state is disturbed, excess carriers are generated in the semiconductor but at any instance, the rate at which, carrier concentration is changing with time is counterbalanced by spatial variation of the current density”. In simple words, it means that if excess carriers are injected into the semiconductor, they flow out so that an electric current is established. The continuity equation is a direct consequence of the law of conservation of charge since the equation demands that there is no indefinite sourcing or sinking of charges. In mathematical form, ∂n ∂t = 1 q ∂Jn ∂x + (Gn −Rn); where, Gn and Rn is called rate of generation and recombination of charge carriers. A similar equation holds for holes with a negative sign for first term of the RHS. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------", "doc_name": "Supplementary notes on Semiconductors by Dr. Suren Patwardhan.pdf", "page": 6, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 4 Semiconductors and Electromagnetism\\Semiconductors\\Supplementary notes on Semiconductors by Dr. Suren Patwardhan.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

Initially an atom is in ground state i.e. all of its electrons possess lowest possible energy states. When energy is given to an atom, it goes to excited state, i.e., its electron jump to higher energy state by absorbing a quantum of radiation or photon. This process is called absorption of radiation.

In process of population inversion, the higher energy state has a greater population than the lower energy state (i.e., N1 < N2). Due to which the emission process dominates, and light in the system undergoes a net increase in intensity. A population inversion is required for laser operation which is possible only in atoms with meta-stable states.

{"text": "Prepared by Dr. Suren Patwardhan 1 Module 1 Unit 1 PRINCIPLES OF LASERS (As per Revised Curriculum SVU R-2023)  Introduction LASER stands for “Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation”. Laser is a directional, focused, monochromatic, coherent and bright source of light. The difference in the nature of laser light from ordinary light is contained in the name itself - the process of stimulated or triggered emission. Ordinary light, on the contrary, is a result of spontaneous or natural emission. Stimulated emission cannot occur at normal conditions. The first successful laser source was the Ruby laser developed by T. H. Maiman in 1960. Following table gives a comparison between laser and ordinary sources of light.  Difference between laser courses and ordinary sources of light Laser Sources Ordinary Sources 1) Laser light consists of almost a single value of wavelength. The spread in wavelength is less than an Angstrom. Light from ordinary sources consists of wide wavelength range. The spread in wavelength can be a few Angstroms for monochromatic sources and thousands of Angstroms for polychromatic sources. 2) Laser light waves are highly coherent i.e. they are in phase with each other. The coherence length is few metres to few kilometres. Ordinary light consists of waves with no definite phase relation. The coherence length is few millimetres to centimetres for all ordinary sources including monochromatic. 3) Laser light has small angular spread, about 106 times smaller than ordinary light. Ordinary sources emit light, which is highly divergent i.e. it has high angular spread. 4) Laser light is directional. It is emitted only in one direction – along the axis of the source. Ordinary light is emitted in all directions. 5) The laser beam is highly intense. Large power is concentrated in a small part. Intensity of ordinary light decreases rapidly with distance as it spreads everywhere. 6) Examples of laser sources: He-Ne laser, Ruby laser, Nd:YAG laser, CO2 laser, diode laser Examples of ordinary sources: CFL, halogen lamp, Na-vapour lamp, incandescent bulb, LED  Laser beam parameters 1. Beam Intensity: It is a measure of optical power output from a laser source per unit area. It is expressed in W/m2. Diode lasers typically have optical power of few mW while some gas lasers and solid state lasers have power output up to several kilowatts. Intensity of any laser source is given by the expression: I = P A, where, P is optical power and A is area of cross-sectional area of laser beam 2. Monochromaticity: It is a measure of linewidth of radiation emitted from a source of light. Ordinary sources have linewidth up to 1010 Hz while laser sources have typical linewidths of 100 Hz only. . 3. Coherence: It is a measure of coherence length. Coherence length refers to time and distance up to which the light waves emitted from a laser source are either in phase or bear a fixed phase difference with each other.

Directionality: It is the property of a laser source. Ordinary light is emitted in all directions. Laser light is emitted only along the axis of the laser source in the form of a cylindrical cavity. 5. Divergence: It is a measure of angular spread of the laser beam as it travels away from a laser source. It is given by the expression: = d1−d2 Z1−Z2, where Z1 and Z2 are axial/perpendicular distance of detector from laser source while d1 and d2 are diameters of laser beam at distance Z1, Z2 respectively.  Inteaction of radiation with matter Behind the emission of radiation in any form including light, there are three processes which involve interaction of radiation with matter. Radiation consists of photons and matter consists of atoms and molecules. Further, the most active constituents of any atom are electrons (at moderate energies upto a few evectron-volts). Obviously, interaction of radiation with matter means interaction of photons with atoms and molecules. The interaction can be as simple as light absorbed by a material or light emitted from a material. There are three processes, which coexist at all temperatures whenever there is an interaction between radiation and matter. Their proportion may change depending upon the material and its temperature. They are Absorption, spontaneous and stimulated emission.  Absorption Consider an atom residing in the lower energy state E1 and a radiation of certain energy is incident. The atom may absorb* the incident energy (if sufficient) and jump to the next energy state E2. This process is called as induced or stimulated absorption because we have to externally supply energy. The atoms will not automatically jump into the excited states. It means there is no spontaneous absorption as such. (*Note that when we say an atom is excited, at all moderate energies upto a few electron volts, these are actually the orbital electrons, which exchage the energies and there are electron transitions. It is just symbolic to call transition of an electron to excited state as excitation of the atom) Corresponding to each transition from E1 to E2, one photon of energy h = E2 – E1 disappears and the atom is excited. The number of atoms excited is by absorption process is given by, dN dt ⌋ ab = B12N1Q Where,", "doc_name": "Lasers - Notes.pdf", "page": 2, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 2 Photonics\\2.1 Laser\\Lasers - Notes.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

Since atoms tend to stay in the lowest possible energy states, most of the photons are absorbed as radiation penetrates the matter i.e. it is attenuated.  Spontaneous emission An atom raised to its excited state does not stay there for long time because the excited state is inherently unstable. Excited atoms rapidly de-excite due to the natural tendency of atoms to seek for the lowest energy state. This type of process in which, atom on its own releases a photon is called as natural or spontaneous emission. Corresponding to each transition E2 to E1, one photon of energy h = E2 – E1 appears. The number of atoms de-excited by spontaneous emission is, dN dt ⌋ sp = A21N2 Where, A21: probability of spontaneous emission process N2: number of atoms in higher energy level E2 The number of spontaneous emission events taking place at any instant is proportional to number of atoms present in the higher energy state. The process of spontaneous emission is completely probabilistic. There is no control over spontaneously emitted radiation as it invloves transitions from varied energy levels with all possible directions and random phase factors. Therefore spontaneously emitted light is incoherent, divergent, diffused and undirected. It may or may not be monochromatic. Light from ordinary sources (e.g. bulb, tube light, LED, Na – light, candle, burner etc) is a result of spontaneous emission.  Stimulated emission This type of process also exists along with the above two processes but at room temperature, spontaneous emission dominates over stimulated emission and the latter is generally negligible.", "doc_name": "Lasers - Notes.pdf", "page": 3, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 2 Photonics\\2.1 Laser\\Lasers - Notes.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}
{"text": "Prepared by Dr. Suren Patwardhan 4 The idea behind stimulated emission is that the probabilities of absorption and emission in the presence of an external trigger like photons are equal. This was first shown statistically by Einstein. A photon of energy h = E2 – E1 or greater can induce the excited atom (via momentum transfer) to de-excite to release energy in the form of another photon. The released photon is identical to the incident photon in every respect. This is called induced or stimulated emission. Corresponding to every induced transition E2 to E1 due to a single photon, two identical photons of energy h = E2 – E1 appear. The number of atoms de-excited by stimulated emission is, dN dt ⌋ st = B21N2Q Where, B21: probability of stimulated emission process N2: number of atoms in higher energy level E2 Q: energy density of incident radiation The number of stimulated emission events taking place at any instant is primarily proportional to number of atoms in the higher energy state.  Advantages of stimulated emission The process of stimulated emission has following advantages over spontaneous emission: 1) The process is controllable from outside. We can control the intensity and energy density of inducing radiation. 2) The induced radiation is identical to the incident radiation in every respect: energy, frequency or wavelength, phase and direction of propagation. 3) By selecting proper active medium and resonance conditions, multiplication of photons is achieved. This leads to oscillations of radiation within a specially prepared region called as optical resonance cavity. As a result, we get a highly monochromatic, coherent, directional, focused and intense. Thus, to obtain laser light means to obtain light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation at a desired wavelength.  Laser-Physics Terms and Concepts When studying lasers, we come across to a number of important terms and concepts. Some of them are listed below to get a brief idea about principles of lasers. 1. Population The number of active atoms occupying a particular energy state is called population of that energy state. Active atoms mean atoms, which are likely to be excited by incident radiation or atoms, which are already excited by absorbing photon/s and are about to de-excite. Thus, N1 and N2 is population of state E1 and E2 respectively. According to Boltzmann’s statistics, the popolations , N1 and N2 are given by N1 = g1e−E1/kT and N2 = g2e−E2/kT where, g1 and g2 are called “degeneracy” of levels E1 and E2 respectively. An energy level is said to be degenerate if the same energy level corresponds to different states (quantum states) of a system. ∴N1 N2 = g1 g2 e(E2−E1)/kT Let both the energy levels E1 and E2 be non-degenerate and are singly occupied (only one quantum state corresponding to one energy level) so that g1 = g2 and ∴ N1 N2 = e(E2−E1)/kT --- (1) At equilibrium, since E2 > E1, N1 >> N2 that is, the lower state E1 is said to be populated as compared to", "doc_name": "Lasers - Notes.pdf", "page": 4, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 2 Photonics\\2.1 Laser\\Lasers - Notes.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

{"text": "Prepared by Dr. Suren Patwardhan 5 2. Equilibrium conditions and Einstein’s coefficients At equilibrium (dynamic equilibrium, where energy exhange takes place), the number of upward transitions is equal to the number of downward transition so that the ratio N1/N2 remains constant. This gives dN dt ⌋ ab = dN dt ⌋ sp + dN dt ⌋ st ∴B12N1Q = A21N2 + B21N2Q According to Einstein’s statistical theory, the probabilities of stimulated events i.e. absorption and emission are the same i.e. is B12 = B21. Therefore we get N1 N2 = 1 + A21 B21Q. Using (1) above, we can write: Q = A21 B21 ( 1 e(E2−E1)/kT −1) Let E2 – E1 corresponds to radiation of energy E = hν, where ν is frequency of radiation according to Planck’s formula. ∴Q = A21 B21 ( 1 ehν/kT −1) Comparing this equation with the Blackbody radiation formula according to Planck’s theory: Q = 8πh𝜈3 𝑐3 ( 1 ehν/kT−1) --- (2) we get A21 B21 = 8πh𝜈3 𝑐3 --- (3) It indicates that the ratio of probabilities of spontaneous to stimulated emission goes as cube of frequency of radfiation emitted. This indicates that achieving laser emission i.e. stimulated emission becomes more and more difficult at higher frequencies or shorter wavelengths. Above ratio is also called ratio of Eintein’s A dn B coefficients. Further, let us find the ratio of rates of spontaneous and stimulated emission: R = dN dt ⌋ sp dN dt ⌋ st = A21N2 B21N2Q = A21 B21Q Using (2) and (3) above, we get R = ehν/kT −1 --- (4) Equation (4) gives the ratio of rates of spontaneous and stimulated emission processes. It indicates that for a given frequency of radiation, the ratio varies exponentially with temperature.  Laser emission is a non-equilibrium process At room temperatures and at thermal equilibrium, absorption and spontaneous emission processes nearly balance each other. At equilibrium, N1 >> N2 and also, A21 > B21. RHS of both terms are less that unity and the stimulated emission is negligible with other two processes. Therefore, we do not observe laser light in normal conditions and the light due to all ordinary sources is a result of spontaneous emission processes.", "doc_name": "Lasers - Notes.pdf", "page": 5, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 2 Photonics\\2.1 Laser\\Lasers - Notes.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}
{"text": "Prepared by Dr. Suren Patwardhan 6 For stimulated emission, Q must be made large enough so that product on RHS of first term becomes greater than unity. Further, we have to make N2 > N1. Since this cannot happen naturally, we have to supply energy to the atoms and maintain them in higher energy levels. To achieve stimulated emission we have to make N2 > N1. But this is reserve condition of what is observed at equilibrium condition. Since we have to disturb the equilibrium condition, lasers are often called as non-equilibrium processes. 3. Population inversion There must be more atoms in the higher energy level E2 than in the lower energy level E1 in order to achieve stimulated emission exclusively. This is a non-equilibrium process as noted above in which the higher energy state is pore populated than the lower energy state. When this situation is achieved, the population between the energy levels E1 and E2 is said to be inverted and the medium or region in which this is achieved is said to be transferred in the state of population inversion. 4. Pumping For maintaining the state of population inversion, the atoms have to be continuously raised to excited states. It requires energy to be supplied to the system from outside. The process of supplying energy to the system with an objective of keeping it into the state of population inversion is called as pumping. Various methods used for pumping are: A) Optical pumping: A source of light (photons) is used to supply energy. For example, in Ruby laser, the Ruby crystal is surrounded by Xenon flash lamp. The material absorbs the incident radiation and a number of Cr3+ ions are excited to higher states. Stimulated emission results if necessary population inversion is achieved properly. B) Electrical pumping: An electric field is set up by a pair of oppositely charged electrodes. For example, in He-Ne laser, the molecules of helium are ionized and accelerated by the electric field. They gain kinetic energy in this process making many molecules to get transferred into the excited states. Stimulated emission results when population inversion is achieved. C) Direct conversion: Electrical current itself achieves pumping. This is achieved in diode lasers. The energy levels used are conduction band and valence band. The forward bias enhances diffusion currents of holes and electrons to flow into either sides getting many electrons in", "doc_name": "Lasers - Notes.pdf", "page": 6, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 2 Photonics\\2.1 Laser\\Lasers - Notes.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}
{"text": "Prepared by Dr. Suren Patwardhan 7 the conduction band and holes in the valence band. The population inversion is established between these energy bands. 5. Pumping schemes Generally, three or more energy levels are involved in the event of laser output (except for diode lasers). The systems in which three energy levels are involved are said to have three-level pumping scheme e.g. Ruby laser and those using four energy levels are said to have four-level pumping scheme e.g. He-Ne laser and Nd:YAG laser. The energy levels, which are actually involved in laser transitions, are called as upper and lower lasing levels and the transition between these states is called as laser transition (indicated by green waves). A) Three level pumping: In three-level pumping, the lower level is normally, the ground state energy level (black coloured). The atoms are first raised from the ground state to an excited state E3 (red coloured). These atoms normally de-excite to an intermediate energy state E2 (blue coloured) by some non-radiative process like emission of heat energy. E2 being a metastable state, the atoms, they have lasing transition from there to the ground state E1 (green coloured). The atoms have to be constantly raised from the ground state to an excited state. It is very difficult to alter the population of the ground state since it is the most stable energy level. High pumping power is required to achieve population inversion. B) Four level pumping: In four-level pumping, lower as well as upper energy levels are some intermediate excited energy states. Atoms are first pumped to an excited state E4 (red coloured). From there, they quickly return to level E3 (blue coloured) by some non-radiative process like emission of heat. E3 being a metastable state, the atoms have a lasing transition to state E2 (green coloured). From E2 again they de-excite to ground state by transferring energy during non-radiatve process like collisions etc. It is easier to achieve population inversion between two excited states rather than pumping atoms continuously from the ground state.", "doc_name": "Lasers - Notes.pdf", "page": 7, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 2 Photonics\\2.1 Laser\\Lasers - Notes.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}
{"text": "Prepared by Dr. Suren Patwardhan 8 Population inversion is achieved faster. Further, Lesser pumping power is required to keep lasing transitions going once the atoms are raised to higher energy levels from the ground state. Therefore four-level pumping schemes are efficient that three-level schemes. C) Two level pumping: This word is quite misleading because the levels are not singular energy states but they are rather energy bands. Such type of pumping is achieved in diode laser. The electrons are transferred from the valence band to the conduction band and they come back to valence band by giving laser radiation (green coloured). Some of the input energy is of course, lost but the diode lasers can give maximum output efficiency even better that 70% at times. 6. Meta stable state Excited atoms have natural tendency to rapidly de-excite to their ground states. This process usually occurs within 10-8 seconds. However, there are certain energy states in which excited atoms can reside for as long as 10-3 seconds. This interval is long compared to normal de- excitation times of atoms. Therefore these states are called metastable states. For stimulated emission to occur, the atoms are required to occupy the upper energy level until the triggering radiation is incident. The metastable state allows accumulation of atoms in a higher energy level and we can practically realise the state of population inversion. Meta stable states are extremely important because they assist in maintaining the condition for population inversion (viz. N2 > N1). Otherwise population of the excited states would rapidly decrease and there would be no laser transitions. In fact, the invention of lasers could not have taken place if elements offering metastable states were not discovered. For example the 2s and 3s states of Ne+ ions having energies 18.7 eV and 20.66 eV, in He-Ne laser, 4p energy state of Ar+ ions in Argon gas laser or 1.4 eV energy level of Cr3+ ions in Ruby laser are actually metastable states. 7. Active system or active medium The region in which the state of population inversion is achieved is called as the active medium or active system. The actual laser light is emitted from this region. The system can be a solid, liquid or gas. Further, the whole system may not take part in population inversion; only a fraction of it is responsible. For example, in semiconductor diode laser, it is the depletion region which goes in the state of population inversion and not the entire diode. In Ruby laser, the lattice sites occupied by Cr3+ ions act as active centres and the Al2O3 crystal (Ruby) just acts as host and heat sink. 8. Resonant cavity/Optical resonator Light emitted in the active medium of a laser source initially consists of mostly spontaneously emitted photons. These photons do trigger stimulated emission but since the inducing photons were randomly directed, the stimulated photons are also scattered in all directions. Moreover, they may be incoherent and have random phase. Thus, there is a requirement of tuning", "doc_name": "Lasers - Notes.pdf", "page": 8, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 2 Photonics\\2.1 Laser\\Lasers - Notes.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

Let γ be the overall gain coefficient and α be the overall loss coefficient of the active medium (resonance cavity). The pumping radiation (stimulus) triggered at any arbitrary point A within the active medium will lead to a stimulated emission. For convenience, let the emitted radiaition is directed towards mirror 1. It gets reflected and traverses through the active medium, gets reflected from mirror 2 and comes back at point A, where it started thus completing a round trip. let the initial intensity of the pumping radiation be I0. Intensity of radiation after traversing distance x from the active medium is given by I(x) = I0e(γ−α)x On reflection at mirror 1, intensity of radiation becomes I(x) = R1I0e(γ−α)x and after reflection at mirror 2 the intensity gets further modified to I(x) = R1R2I0 e(γ−α)x. Thus, after one round trip, the intensity will become I = I(x = 2L) = R1R2I0e(γ−α)2L ∴ I I0 = R1R2e(γ−α)2L. I I0 < 1  net attenuation, laser radiation dies out. I I0 > 1  net amplification I I0 = 1  sustained oscillations The last two conditions together correspond to light amplification, which is an essential step for laser emission. In particular, the last condition tells about the condition on overall gain factor for onset of stimulated emission dominance over spontaneous emission. By taking I I0 = 1, we get R1R2e(γ−α)2L = 1 or e(γ−α)2L = 1 R1R2 Taking log on both sides, (γ −α)2L = ln ( 1 R1R2). Rearranging, we get γ = α + 1 2L ln ( 1 R1R2) --- (5) Equation (5) above is called as “threshold condition fo lasing action”. ============================================== END OF DOCUMENT", "doc_name": "Lasers - Notes.pdf", "page": 9, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 2 Photonics\\2.1 Laser\\Lasers - Notes.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

{"text": "Prepared by Dr. Suren Patwardhan 1 Module 1 Unit 2 OPTICAL FIBRES (As per Revised Curriculum SVU R-2023)  Introduction Our globe is physically connected by means of optical fibres. Worth to mention, the “online” mode of work is impossible without optical fibres. Since when the Standard Telecom Labs of England announced optical fibres with low transmission losses, there has been phenomenal grown in the fibre optics applications in the last 50 years. At present, optical fibres offer the safest, cheapest, fastest and highest capacity data transfer media. Apart from their use in communications, optical fibres find applications in other fields like surgery, defence and sensors.  Basic information about optical fibres Optical fibres are glass or plastic solid threads (not hollow like capillary), which are designed to propagate light typically in the IR region. Their main function is to accept and transmit as much light as possible along their length. The principle on which, optical fibres work is called as “total internal reflection”. An optical fibre basically consists of two coaxial regions called the (inner) “core” and the (outer) “cladding”. Usually these regions cannot be visually distinguished from each other since the only difference between them being that of refractive index and that is too, very small (on the order of 0.01 to 0.1). The core diameter varies from 5 to 125 µm while the cladding diameter is usually 25 to 500 µm. An optical fibre possesses an “acceptance cone”, which is a measure of its light gathering capacity. It basically indicates that if rays of light from a source fall within this cone, then only they would undergo total internal reflection. Optical fibres are characterized by two important parameters called the “numerical aperture” and the “normalised frequency” or “V-number”.  Advantages of Optical Fibres 1) Cheaper, smaller, lighter, durable, chemically stable and mechanically flexible. 2) Safer, immune to stray EM signals, reduced cross-links, noise-free. 3) High bandwidth, very high data speeds. 4) Lower losses.", "doc_name": "Optical Fibre Notes.pdf", "page": 1, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 2 Photonics\\2.2 Optical Fibre\\Optical Fibre Notes.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}
{"text": "Prepared by Dr. Suren Patwardhan 2  Principle of operation – Total Internal Reflection This is the basic principle on which, any optical fibre works. It is explained with the help of following diagrams. Consider a ray of light going from a region of higher refractive (say n1) index towards a region of lower refractive index (say n2). Let “i\" be the angle of incidence and “r” be the angle of refraction. The ray would deflect away from the normal (r < i) as n2 < n1. The ray will undergo partial reflection and refraction (or transmission) in general. Now, the angle of refraction will go on increasing with the angle of incidence, and there would be some critical value of the angle of incidence say i = i0 for which, the refracted ray moves almost parallel to the interface as shown. This angle of incidence is called “critical angle of incidence”. At this angle, sin(i) = n2 n1. If we increase i further, there would be no transmission and complete reflection occurs. The ray is said to undergo total internal reflection (TIR). It occurs when a ray of light moving through a denser medium, falls on the surface of rarer medium at critical angle or above. In an optical fibre, the core is the denser medium and cladding being the rarer medium. The fibre supports passage of rays of light remaining in the core region and undergoing successive total internal reflections.  Types of Optical Fibres Depending upon applications, optical fibres are classified into single mode (SM) and multimode (MM) fibres. In simple context, modes refer to total number of allowed paths inside the core. Multimode fibres are further classified into step index (SI) and grade index (GRIN) fibres. In SI fibre, RI of core is uniform and changes abruptly at the core-cladding interface while in GRIN fibre, RI", "doc_name": "Optical Fibre Notes.pdf", "page": 2, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 2 Photonics\\2.2 Optical Fibre\\Optical Fibre Notes.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}
{"text": "Prepared by Dr. Suren Patwardhan 3 varies gradually within the core region from axis of fibre towards core-cladding interface. The graded index fibre can be graded in a linear, parabolic or in a staircase manner. Another classification is based on material used for fibre. The all glass fibres offer the superior quality of data transmission and they are becoming common presently. Earlier, all plastic or plastic coated silica (PCS) fibres were in use offering a cheaper option to all glass fibres, which were at higher cost then. All these classifications are summarized in diagram.  Refractive index profile The variation of refractive index with axial distance from the central axis of an optical fibre is often called as “refractive index profile”. For SI and GRIN optical fibres, it is shown in following diagrams:  Ray propagation in different fibres In single mode fibre, light rays make very small angle with the axis and they propagate almost parallel to the axis of fibre. In step index multimode fibre, along with the axial direction, rays can move along different directions going away from the axis undergoing multiple internal reflections (zig-zag path). Further, the rays can traverse their path either within the axial plane (meridional rays) or through non-axial planes (skew rays). In graded index multimode fibre, the rays undergo constant deviation in their path as the refractive index continuously changes within the core from its axis towards the cladding boundary. The paths traversed by rays of light through different types of optical fibres are shown in following figures:  Single mode (SM)  Multimode – Graded Index (MM-GI)", "doc_name": "Optical Fibre Notes.pdf", "page": 3, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 2 Photonics\\2.2 Optical Fibre\\Optical Fibre Notes.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

In other words, it is the light gathering capacity of an optical fibre. The acceptance cone indicates limiting cone through which, light from a source must fall in order to undergo total internal reflection inside the fibre. It is a cone having semi-vertical angle 0 as shown in the same figure. The numerical aperture is the sine of this angle at the critical value for which, the condition of total internal reflection is satisfied. Thus, Numerical Aperture i.e. NA = sinθC.

In ΔAOB, sinφC = cos(90 −φC) = cos i0 = √1 −sin2 i0 From step (1), n0 sin θC = n1 sinφC = n1√1 −sin2 i0 Using step (2), n0 sin θC = n1√1 −sin2 i0 = n1√1 − n2 2 n1 2 = √n1 2 −n2 2 But the quantity n0 sin θC is the Numerical Aperture. Thus, we get, NA = √n1 2 −n2 2 Note: For ray incident from air, n0 = 1. For optical fibres, it is a common practice to express the numerical aperture in more simplified form as NA ≈n1√2∆ Where,  is known as fractional refractive index difference and it is defined as ∆ = n1−n2 n2 .  Modes of Propagation In simple context, a mode of propagation refers to the allowed path for a ray of light inside optical fibre. Although the basic condition of total internal reflection is satisfied, the fibre does not support all the rays falling within the cone of acceptance. It fibre allows only certain selective paths. They are dependent upon the ratio of wavelength of light to and diameter of the core region. These allowed paths of rays of light are known as modes of propagation. The allowed directions for rays of light can be axial i.e. light propagating along or parallel to the axis of fibre or non-axial i.e. light undergoing successive internal reflections. Accordingly, the rays are called axial ray or axial mode and zigzag ray or non-axial mode respectively. The non-axial mode can further be meridional or skew. A meridional ray follows a zigzag path crossing the axis while a skew ray follows a zigzag path and does not cross the axis. Various possible modes of propagation are represented in following figure:", "doc_name": "Optical Fibre Notes.pdf", "page": 5, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 2 Photonics\\2.2 Optical Fibre\\Optical Fibre Notes.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}
{"text": "Prepared by Dr. Suren Patwardhan 6 In a deeper sense, the optical fibre serves as waveguide for light waves of certain wavelength passing through. In order to satisfy the electromagnetic boundary conditions inside a waveguide for electromagnetic waves, certain conditions demand that depending upon the ratio d / , where, d is the core diameter and  is the wavelength of light, the light waves are in phase only along certain directions with respect to axis of fibre so that they reinforce each other. These directions along which, light waves are in phase are called as modes.  V-Number and number of allowed modes of propagation An optical fibre is characterized by another important parameter called as the V-number or normalized frequency. It is given by, V = 2πa λ × NA Where, “a” is the radius of core,  is the wavelength of light and NA is the numerical aperture. The maximum number of modes supported by the fibre is given by, Nm = V2 2 ; For multimode step index = V2 4 ; For multimode graded index (parabolic) Further from electromagnetic theory, it follows that for V < 2.405, the fibre works as single mode fibre i.e. it supports only axial modes  Attenuation in optical fibres Although optical fibres are potentially far more superior than any other means of communications such as metallic cables (twisted pair, coaxial or BNC, wireless communication etc), they also suffer from some practical problems such as attenuation. Attenuation is the loss of signal while it is propagating in the form of light waves through an optical fibre. Attenuation is measured in a decibel scale (dB), which is a logarithmic scale. The attenuation coefficient is given by, α = 1 L 10 log ( Pin Pout) /m (usually expressed in dB/km)", "doc_name": "Optical Fibre Notes.pdf", "page": 6, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 2 Photonics\\2.2 Optical Fibre\\Optical Fibre Notes.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}
{"text": "Prepared by Dr. Suren Patwardhan 7 There may be various reasons for this loss but their collective effect is a measure of attenuation. Normally, attenuation is expressed in dB/km. Optical fibres have typically an attenuation of 0.1-0.2 dB/km as compared to copper cables which offer 2-3 dB/km at the best. Following are the major contributors to attenuation of signal through optical fibre: 1) Absorption: There are two types of absorption agents: intrinsic and impurities. The absorption of light energy by material of the fibre i.e. glass or plastic itself is known as intrinsic absorption. Glass has two strong absorption ranges from 0.1 to 0.3 µm (UV range) and 7 to 12 µm (IR range). These are terms as electronic absorption and molecular vibrational absorption respectively. Plastic fibres have much higher absorption range and thus offer higher attenuation. However, impurities are chief contributors to absorption. These impurities can be minimized but it is impossible to remove them completely. Some impurities such as OH– radicals mix up during the fibre manufacturing process itself. Other impurities such as Cu, Ni, Cr, V and Mn are also responsible for heavy absorption losses. 2) Rayleigh scattering: It occurs because of light passing through a medium having non-uniform distribution of mass and density. The amount of scattering is proportional to 1/4 where,  is the wavelength of light. Optical fibres are made from glass or plastics. Both these media are disordered (amorphous) structures and have local microscopic variations in density which it tern caused local variations in refractive index. 3) Geometric effects: They occur due to manufacturing defects such as irregularity in fibre dimensions (core and cladding diameters), stress developed due to fibre coating and cabling process, bends, kinks while installation etc. Geometric effect also includes bending losses. If a fibre in bent into a loop, the signal is attenuated due to loss of critical angle for part of incident light and it is known as bending loss.  Optical window: The net attenuation as a function of wavelength is a result of many factors. It is shown in following figure, where the losses are plotted from practically measured data. Both, the absorption and scattering losses are major contributors to attenuation plot. It can be seen that the net attenuation is lower in two ranges of wavelengths: around 1.3 µm and around 1.55 µm. these small ranges of wavelengths are called optical windows. Most of the LEDs or laser diodes are designed to emit in these ranges so that light undergo minimum attenuation.", "doc_name": "Optical Fibre Notes.pdf", "page": 7, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 2 Photonics\\2.2 Optical Fibre\\Optical Fibre Notes.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}
{"text": "Prepared by Dr. Suren Patwardhan 8  Dispersion in optical fibres Any practical optical fibre suffers from another problem – dispersion. It refers to the broadening of pulse as light travels through an optical fibre. The original waveform is distorted due to dispersion of light. It is measured in ns/km. This problem is typical of optical fibres only. There are three mechanisms those lead to bad signal due to dispersion of light. 1) Material dispersion: Glass or plastic used for optical fibre is a dispersive medium. It results in different wavelength components moving at different speeds through the fibre. Due to this, for light from some source such as an LED which consists of different wavelengths, the shorter wavelength component travels slower than the longer wavelength component and the light pulse tends to broaden. This type of dispersion depends upon the spectral width of the source. Material dispersion can be greatly reduced by using laser sources. However, use of laser diodes is not always desirable as laser circuits are costlier than LED circuits. 2) Waveguide dispersion: Although the ray of light is totally internally reflected, part of light energy penetrates into the cladding region. This happens as the traveling wave is an electromagnetic wave nd the medium in which it travels is a dielectric. So there is an induced electric field in the cladding. Now as the wave propagates further, part of light penetrated into the cladding region travels little faster than the main part, which is confined to the core region. This leads to what is called as waveguide dispersion. This kind of problem is significant in a single mode fibre as the core diameter is extremely small. 3) Inter-modal dispersion: As different modes are directed along different directions, the time taken by different modes to cover a certain distance in optical fibre is different. The axial ray would take the least time while non-axial rays (zigzag rays) would take longer time. This problem occurs particularly in step index multimode fibre. As axial ray moves straight, it covers a longer lineal distance whereas the non-axial rays move in a zigzag manner and cover a shorter lineal distance depending upon their angle. Thus, after some time interval, all the modes do not come together at a point and their synchronization is lost.", "doc_name": "Optical Fibre Notes.pdf", "page": 8, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 2 Photonics\\2.2 Optical Fibre\\Optical Fibre Notes.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}
{"text": "Prepared by Dr. Suren Patwardhan 9 This problem is overcome in graded index fibres by linearly varying the refractive index of core. The ray trajectory is shown in figure above. The refractive index is maximum at the axis and decreases towards the cladding. The axial ray has a shorter linear distance to cover but it travels with the lowest speed as it moves through a region of highest refractive index. A non-axial ray has to cover a longer linear distance but as it moves towards cladding, its speed increases due to reduction in the refractive index. Thus, longer distance is compensated by higher speed and al the modes remain synchronous.  Maximum bit rate (B) Dispersion in fibres is usually expressed in ns/km or ps/km. The intermodal dispersion is given by τi = 𝑛1L c ∆ for SI fibre and τi = 𝑛2L 2c ∆2 for GRIN fibre (parabolic profile) Here, L is length of fibre and c is speed of light The total dispersion (neglecting waveguide dispersion) is given by τ = √τi 2 + τm 2 , where τm is material dispersion. The maximum data speed or “bit rate” is theoretically given by B ≈ 0.7 𝜏 bits/sec.

{"text": "Prepared by Dr. Suren Patwardhan 10 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES  Application in Telecommunication Traditionally, telecommunications systems use radio frequencies or microwaves for transmission through a communication channel. For wireless communications, different techniques are used (e.g. routers). In any case, the signals are transmitted at frequencies in the range up to gigahertz (GHz). Optical fibres offer great advantages in terms of higher bandwidth as they are operated at much higher optical frequencies (hundreds of terahertz (THz) to petahertz (PHz = 1015 Hz), Optical fibres also offer the lowest losses, they are cheaper and safer mode of communications. Today, a humongous network of optical fibre cables running throughout the globe connects the entire world (physically). There are optical fibre cables submerged deep in oceans. A typical optical fibre communication system consists of transmitter unit, receiver unit and channel or waveguide 1) Transmitter unit: Normally, it consists of two modules the electrical data generator and the optical converter. The input data may be in any form; a music note, a photograph etc. It is first converted into an equivalent electric pulse with proper modulation of the signal. For this, normally a high frequency carrier wave is generated. Two forms of modulation are possible: analogue and digital. Digital modulation is more commonly used in fibre optic communication where, the signal is coded using discrete bits. The driver circuit converts this coded electrical signal into optical form. An LED or a Laser diode is the actual converter. 2) Receiver unit: This also consists of minimum two modules. The data in the form of light brought through the optical fibre cable is connected to a photo detector. It is normally off but when light is incident on it, it generates a small current pulse. This pulse is very small (in microamperes) and often requires amplification to a predetermined value. Then, there are amplifiers, wave- shaper and transducer circuit to retain the original form of the signal. 3) Repeater unit, optical fibres and couplers: The signal in the form of light suffers from attenuation and distortion. Therefore, repeater units are required at regular intervals to redesign the signal in both, amplitude and waveform. The optical fibres used may be of different variety: single mode, step index or graded index (multimode) depending upon the type, amount of data, quality requirements and environment. The optical couplers are crucial parts of the system. Special design is required to connect a fibre-source, fibre-detector and many-to-one or one-to-many fibres. ============================================== END OF DOCUMENT", "doc_name": "Optical Fibre Notes.pdf", "page": 10, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 2 Photonics\\2.2 Optical Fibre\\Optical Fibre Notes.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

Physics Module 1 Unit 1 THIN FILM INTERFERENCE – NOTES (As per SVU-R2020 Scheme & Syllabus)  Introduction Interference of light is a typical wave phenomenon. We can explain the brightness and particularly darkness in the interference pattern on the basis of superposition principle obeyed by light waves. It says the resultant amplitude of two waves arriving at a point simultaneously is given by the vector sum of the individual amplitudes. There are two ways to study interference: one, division of wave front in which, we consider that the incident wave front splits into two secondary wave fronts using pin-holes etc. and waves from these secondary wave fronts superimpose. Experiments like Young’s Double slit or Lloyd’s mirror are studied using this concept. Second, division of amplitude in which, we consider that the incident beam splits into two parts by partial reflection and transmission and these two parts superimpose on each other. Interference taking place in thin transparent film and Newton’s rings are studied using the second concept. However, it is only a matter of practice and the Mathematics and Physics behind them is the same.  Examples of interference In order to achieve a steady and well-defined interference pattern, we need to satisfy certain conditions like monochromatic and coherent sources, narrow and close slits or pinholes etc. Although such conditions are required in a strict sense, interference of light is not restricted only to laboratory and many interference effects can be observed in everyday life around us. Appearance of colours from a soap bubble, reflection of brilliant colours from oil films (particularly in rainy days), colours observed on the wings of a butterfly, holograms, sunglasses, optical filters, coatings on camera lenses and binoculars, spectacles with antiglare coatings etc. are in fact, examples of interference of light.  Thin transparent film of uniform thickness There is no unique answer to what do you mean by “thin”. It should be taken in a relative sense. As far as optics goes, by thin film we mean film whose thickness is comparable with the wavelength of light illuminating it. Films having thickness near to or at the most a few times the average wavelength of visible light can safely be called as “thin films”. A film having thickness several times the wavelength is called “thick film”. The thickness of a film plays the same role as that of separation between two coherent sources used in Young’s double slit-like experiments. As the thickness of film increases, the coherence between the two interfering parts is lost and we do not obtain any interference pattern from thick films. Glass slabs for example, do not produce a clear interference pattern. We consider a parallel beam of light incident on a thin transparent film of uniform thickness “t” and refractive index “µ”. As shown in the figure, multiple reflections would take place. However, much of the incident light will get transmitted through the film.

The 3rd and higher reflections have negligible effect and we consider only the first two reflected rays for finding interference conditions. It can also be seen that interference of reflected light will be well defined since the two reflected parts have comparable intensity but the interference of transmitted light will be poor since the first transmitted part has much higher intensity that the second transmitted part.  Interference in reflected light Let “I” be the incident ray, R1 and R2 be the first and second reflected rays. As mentioned above, only the first two reflections are considered for interference. Let “i” and “r” be the angle of incidence and refraction respectively. Ray R1 undergoes phase reversal due to reflection from the surface of denser medium while ray R2 does not undergo any phase change. Hence the net phase change is π. The optical path difference between the interfering rays R1 and R2 is given by opd = µ(AB + BC) −AD ± λ 2 We have multiplied the first term by R.I of the medium to get effective path covered by the ray R2 since it travels in a medium with a slower speed as compared to R1, which is moving through air.

Physics time factor would be equal to the ratio of speed of light in air to the speed in the medium, which is nothing but the R.I. Further, the factor λ/2 arises due to the net phase change of π radian between R1 and R2. Here, AB = BC = t cos r and AD = 2μt sin2 r cos r. Thus, the conditions of interference become 2μt cos r = (2n −1)  2; Maxima or brightness 2μt cos r = n; Minima or darkness n = 1, 2, 3 … When the film is illuminated by monochromatic light, depending upon film thickness and angle of incidence, the condition of either constructive or destructive interference will be satisfied all-over the film. So, the film will appear bright or dark all over and we do not get interference bands as such. When illuminated by white light, few colours get reflected constructively from the surface while few other colours are absent. The best example is that of colours formed on soap bubbles or soap films. Note: If we have a configuration as shown in following figure, both the rays R1 and R2 would undergo phase reversal and the net phase reversal is 2π, which does not add any path difference. Here, the interference conditions would be complementary to above conditions. Formation of colours The condition for constructive interference for light reflected from a uniformly thin film is 2μt cos r = (2n −1)  2; n = 1, 2, 3 … White light consists of different wavelengths. If it is incident on a thin transparent film of uniform thickness, certain wavelength/s may satisfy the condition for constructive interference while some other wavelength/s may satisfy the condition for destructive interference for some fixed value of film thickness and angle of incidence. Colours (wavelengths) which satisfy the condition for constructive interference appear bright in the reflected light while colours (wavelengths) which satisfy the condition for destructive interference are cut-off from the reflected light. Therefore, the film appears to be coloured; the colour/s being that/those of the wavelength/s, which interfere constructively.  Interference in the transmitted light For light transmitted from a thin transparent film of uniform thickness, waves are reflected from upper and lower surfaces of the film (internal reflections), which is a denser medium.

Physics reflections occur at the surface of air (rarer medium), there is no phase change and the factor /2 does not arise. Refer to the diagram. So, in this case, the optical path difference is given by opd = µ(AB + BC) −AD Note that the factor 𝜆 2 is missing as there is no phase reversal. Due to this, the conditions of interference would be complementary to those obtained in the reflected light.

Physics  Anti-reflecting and anti-transmitting films Interference involving multiple reflections (thin film, wedge shaped film, Newton’s rings) has wide range of applications. Here, we will focus on application to anti-reflecting and anti-transmitting films.  Anti-reflecting films  Single layer film: The lenses used in optical instruments like telescopes, binoculars camera are often coated with a thin layer of transparent material like magnesium fluoride (MgF2) or cryolite (3NaF, AlF3) to avoid unwanted reflections as these reflection cause distortion in the image quality. Such films are called as anti-reflection films (ARF). The material coated has to satisfy two main requirements apart from basic requirements like good adhesion to glass, durability etc. (a) Condition on refractive index: This condition says that the amplitudes of two rays R1 and R2 must be equal to obtain effective interference. Amplitude of R1 = ( μf−1 μf+1) 2 and Amplitude of R2 = ( μg−μf μg+μf) 2 The requirement R1 = R2 yields μf = √μg (b) Condition on thickness: This condition says that thickness of the film should be such that it gives rise to destructive interference of reflected light. We have opd = 2μft cos r. Assuming normal incidence, for destructive interference of rays R1 and R2, 2μft = (2n −1)  2; n = 1, 2, 3...  t =  4μf  Multilayer films: A single layer antireflection film is effective only at a certain wavelength and cannot totally reduce the reflection. Therefore, in practice, often multilayer films coatings are used. A three later coating system is widely used and effective over most of the visible spectrum coming from sunlight or lamps. In this, the central layer is made of high R. I. medium such as zirconium dioxide, ZrO2 ( = 2.10) and it has thickness = /2. The outermost layer is mostly of magnesium fluoride, MgF2 ( = 1.38) and it has R1 R2 Film (µf) Air ((µ = 1) Glass (µg) t", "doc_name": "Notes on Thin film interference.pdf", "page": 5, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 1 Wave Optics\\1.1 Interference\\Notes on Thin film interference.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}
{"text": "Prepared by: Dr. Suren Patwardhan Page 6 of 6 F Y B Tech 2022-23\\Engg. Physics thickness = /4. The innermost layer is of medium having intermediate R.I. such as caesium fluoride, CsF3 ( = 1.63) and it has thickness = /4. In some important applications like high resolution cameras or metallurgical microscopes, as many as 100 layered coatings are used. For most of the medium-quality SLR camera lenses, binoculars, telescopes etc. a three-layer coating is sufficient.  Anti-transmitting films (single layer) In some applications, it is desirable to have anti-transmitting films. Here also the glasses are coated with similar materials and their thickness is adjusted so as to avoid any transmission through the film. As before, the material coated has to satisfy two main requirements. One of them being that of refractive index which is covered in section 1.4.1 (a). The other condition viz. that of thickness is based upon formation of destructive interference in the transmitted light. For the air-film-lass combination described as above, the condition for minima in the transmitted light is given by, 2μft cos 𝜃= nλ; n = 1, 2, 3... Assuming normal incidence, the minimum film thickness for the film to act as anti-transmitting is given by, t =  2μf. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Optical surface (Lens, glass plate etc.) MgF2 t = /4 CsF3 t = /4 ZrO2 t = /4 T1 T2 Film (µf) Air ((µ = 1) Glass (µg) t", "doc_name": "Notes on Thin film interference.pdf", "page": 6, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\Physics\\Module 1 Wave Optics\\1.1 Interference\\Notes on Thin film interference.pdf", "subject": "Engineering physics", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

We cannot perform implicit type casting on the data types which are not compatible with each other such as: 1. Converting float to an int will truncate the fraction part hence losing the meaning of the value. 2. Converting double to float will round up the digits. 3.

{"text": "Key characteristics and uses of flags in C++ • Signaling Conditions: • Flags are primarily used to indicate whether a certain condition has been met or a specific event has occurred. For example, a found_item flag could be set to true once an item is located in a search operation. • Controlling Program Flow: • The value of a flag can be used in conditional statements (like if-else or switch) to determine which code path to execute. This allows for dynamic behavior based on runtime conditions. • Synchronization in Concurrency: • In multithreaded programming, flags can be used as simple synchronization mechanisms. For instance, a flag can signal that a shared resource is currently in use, preventing other threads from accessing it simultaneously. • Indicating Options/Settings: • Flags can represent program settings or options, where different values correspond to different configurations. This is common in command-line arguments, where flags like -v (verbose) or - d (debug) can alter program output or behavior. • Error Handling: • A flag can be set to indicate the presence of an error, allowing subsequent code to handle the error condition gracefully. vaibhav.vasani@gmail.com", "doc_name": "2.6 SPM Flag Concepts.pdf", "page": 6, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\SPM\\Module 2 Program Control Functions\\2.6 SPM Flag Concepts.pdf", "subject": "SPM", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}

{"text": "10/4/2025 Programming in C Source: Google images wherever required Write a program to find duplicate element in array Use two arrays: one to store the input numbers (arr) and another (freq) to keep track of whether an element has already been counted. Algorithm Initialization: The program first prompts the user to enter the size of the array, n. It declares two integer arrays: arr of size n to store the user-inputted numbers, and freq of size n to store the frequency of each element. A counter variable count is initialized to 0 to store the final count of duplicate elements. Input and freq Array Setup: The code uses a for loop to read n elements from the user into the arr array. Simultaneously, it initializes all elements of the freq array to -1. This value acts as a flag, indicating that the element at the corresponding index in arr has not yet been processed or counted.", "doc_name": "Module 3.1 & 3.2 Arrays & Character arrays & String handling functions.pdf", "page": 48, "source_path": "C:\\Users\\shaur\\Master Folder\\Development\\College\\Hackathon\\CampusKnowledgeBase\\data\\FY\\Sem-1\\SPM\\Module 3 Arrays\\Module 3.1 & 3.2 Arrays & Character arrays & String handling functions.pdf", "subject": "SPM", "category": "Theory", "semester": "1", "source": "Google Drive"}
{"text": "10/4/2025 Write a program to find duplicate element in array Counting Duplicates: The core of the algorithm is a nested for loop. The outer loop iterates through each element of the arr array, from index i = 0 to n-1. Inside the outer loop, there's a check: if (freq[i] == -1). This condition ensures that the algorithm only processes an element that hasn't been counted as a duplicate before. The inner loop starts at j = i + 1 and iterates to the end of the array. Its purpose is to compare the element arr[i] with all subsequent elements arr[j]. If a match is found (arr[i] == arr[j]), it means a duplicate has been found. The duplicateCount for arr[i] is incremented, and the freq[j] is set to 0. Setting freq[j] to 0 is a crucial step; it marks the duplicate element at index j as \"visited\" or \"counted,\" preventing it from being processed again by the outer loop. After the inner loop completes, if duplicateCount for the element at index i is greater than 1, it means that arr[i] had at least one duplicate. If duplicates are found, the count of total duplicate elements is incremented, and freq[i] is set to duplicateCount (or any value other than -1, marking it as processed).
